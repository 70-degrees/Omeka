Resources (one for each controller)
	Items
	Collections
	Files
	Tags
	Users
	Plugins
	Settings
	Themes
	Types
	
Privileges/Rules/Actions (we should come up with a unified terminology for this,
it is referred to by different nomenclature in different parts of the app)	
	Depends on the resource
	Most common are:
		add
		edit
		delete
	
	Show/Browse privileges are not included for most Resources (except those 
	that should be limited to administrators, like Plugins,Users,etc.)	
	

Each Item can be set as public/not public, and currently there is a privilege for 
the Items resource called 'showNotPublic', which is also applied in the Tags and 
Files controller
	
	A more complicated set of permissions would necessitate persistent storage in
	the DB for Items and their associated permission levels.  
	IMO it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to contribute an object/Item to an archive
	and then have it set to a restrictive permission level such that only a small 
	subset of Omeka users (or even just the individual who uploaded it) could see it.


Permissions work on several levels:

	Admin interfaces are only available with a login
	
	Specific actions should be regulated on a per type basis
	
	Specific items should have permissions that allow some users to see them vs others
