More than 100 days since Hurricane Katrina’s storm surge breached our levees, at least two of those levees (London Avenue & 17th Street) remain broken, allowing water to flow into the city.      \r\n\r\nThis man-made disaster did not have to happen.  At the London Avenue canal, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency who oversaw its construction, specified 26-feet deep sheet pilings to anchor the concrete walls, however, independent investigators found breached pilings just 10 feet deep into the ground!  \r\n\r\nResidents, whose homes and businesses were destroyed when millions of gallons of water barreled through them, do not feel safe returning to a city with a broken levee.  By not acting, you are sentencing New Orleans to death and it citizens a permanent exile.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1718, New Orleans is older than United States and boasts a culture and cuisine unlike any other American city.  The port, at the mouth of the Mississippi river, is a vital transportation hub for American goods; much of oil refinery industry is based there and the seafood trade is immense.  America must not give up on New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812, the British burned Washington, D.C.  In 1906, an earthquake and fire destroyed San Francisco.  In 1871 and 1910, fires ravaged Chicago.  In 1994, the Northridge earthquake wrought havoc in Los Angeles.  After each disaster, America rebuilt.  It is now time to rebuild New Orleans.  \r\n\r\nIf you have not yet toured the damage, go now.  You cannot truly understand the scale of destruction until you visit.  This will be an extremely difficult holiday season for the hundreds of thousands of displaced Americans whose futures are still uncertain because the federal government still has not committed to repairing the levees to the original Category 3 protection specifications.\r\n\r\nRemember, by the time Katrina reached New Orleans, it was a Category 3 hurricane.  Please help us rebuild our levees to their original Category 3 protection specification. \r\n\r\nIt would be un-American and shameful to abandon New Orleans.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nAlden Oreck\r\nA Proud American\r\n');

Through the Jewish Community Partnership, counseling, case management, insurance assistance, and seniors programming have been offered.  Our goal has always to been, and continues to be, that evacuees feel they have a home in Baton Rouge for as long as they remain here.\r\n\r\nShortly after Katrina, the Federation began to receive donations from scores of contributors, the vast majority from out of state.  To manage and allocate these funds, the Federation established the Jewish Federation of Greater Baton Rouge Disaster Relief Fund, with an allocations committee chaired by Donna Sternberg and comprised of Ralph Bender, Jeff  Dubinsky, Melanie Fields, Erich Sternberg, and Lynn Weill. Working closely with United Jewish Communities, the Disaster Fund has been able to provide funding for programs and initiatives that complement UJC''s efforts and expand the range of assistance offered victims of last summer’s storms.\r\n\r\nFor example, through a generous gift from Hans and Donna Sternberg, the Disaster Fund was able to bring Rabbi Irwin Kula and Rabbi Tsvi Blanchard of CLAL to Baton Rouge and New Orleans last December for a series of events that focused on healing and renewal. The New Orleans events were the first Jewish Community Events to be held in the city since Katrina.\r\n\r\nA central focus of the Fund’s activities has been insuring that displaced children and youth receive the support they need.  The Disaster Relief Fund provided educational grants to 57 New Orleans students (Pre-Kindergarten through College) who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina, provided necessary structural upgrades that allowed the Rayner Center to take in displaced babies and children, and provided funding that allowed BARFTY to expand and provide a home away from home for displaced New Orleans teenagers.  The Disaster Fund has recently awarded significant grants to The Foundation for Jewish Camping’s HaBayita Program and to Henry S. Jacobs Camp to help insure that every child displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita can attend Jewish Camp this summer if they wish to.\r\n\r\nSince the Federation does not have the infrastructure to provide programs directly to the larger Baton Rouge community, we have financially supported trusted partners who do so. The Disaster Fund has awarded grants to the Greater Baton Rouge Federation of Churches and Synagogues, which operates feeding programs for the needy, the St. Vincent DePaul Free Pharmacy and Shelter Program, The Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank, and Project RISE, a program of the YMCA that works to prevent the spread of AIDS.  All of these community programs have seen their resources severely taxed by the influx of evacuees from New Orleans. \r\n\r\nThe Disaster Fund’s Allocations Committee has recently awarded two grants that I am excited to share with you.  The first is a grant to Congregation B’nai Israel, part of which will offset expenses occurred when the congregation opened its doors to those in need of shelter in the immediate aftermath of Katrina.  B’nai Israel’s Hurricane Relief Committee has continued its efforts with a special focus on working with the evacuees living in the FEMA trailer villages. Part of the Disaster Fund’s grant was given to The B’nai Israel Hurricane Relief Fund to support the work they are doing.  \r\n\r\nThe second grant was made to Beth Shalom Synagogue. As you may know, Beth Shalom acted as a staging center for the Federation’s rescue efforts, coordinated lodging for those rescued, and served as a temporary home for numerous Jewish agencies from New Orleans. The synagogue was severely damaged by Hurricane Rita and the congregation’s insurance claim has recently been denied.  The Federation’s Disaster Fund donation will help with needed repairs.\r\n\r\nThe aftermath to last year’s storms is proving to be a great challenge to our small Jewish community, but we have responded courageously. Just as Baton Rouge has grown, so has our Jewish population. I have been encouraged by the outpouring of support for our new neighbors, and the energy of the volunteers we count on to provide the services and programs which you all expect from the Federation. In the coming months you will continue to see this commitment grow in many forms, including amazing activity by Hillel at LSU, Baton Rouge’s first Jewish Film Festival, and a renewed presence by Jewish Family Services. \r\n\r\nNone of this would be possible without your generosity and commitment to our Jewish community and values. I am confident we will face the future with the courage, strength, and faith that carried us through Katrina and Rita, and that has always been a hallmark of the Jews of Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErich Sternberg\r\nPresident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n');
INSERT INTO `metatext` (`metatext_id`, `metafield_id`, `object_id`, `metatext_text`) VALUES (4, 5, 6, 'Erath, Louisiana 2005\r\nby Alex Rubin\r\nThe stench was overwhelming and brought tears to my eyes.  The carpet was still sopping wet over 4 months after Hurricane Rita.  Everything in sight was covered with green, red, black and white mold.  And this was going to be the site of my eagerly anticipated vacation.\r\nAlong with 15 other Jewish volunteers from Newton and Needham, 9 of them teenagers, my mom and I decided to go to New Iberia, Louisiana, during our winter vacation to help victims of Hurricane Rita.  Our assignment for the next 4 days would be to clean out and take apart houses that have been damaged by the 30 foot surges.  As my mom said, it was time to take action and do something to help, instead of just talking about how awful it was or just giving money.\r\nOur first stop was at Nate and Kim''s house in Erath, Louisiana.  Erath is a rural area, about 2 hours west of Baton Rouge, surrounded by sugar cane farms.  It is as flat as anyone can imagine and the storm just overwhelmed this area.  Kim was 5 months pregnant and Nate had lost his truck driving job because of the hurricane.  Before the storm, they had lived in a nice brick house, surrounded by extended family members.  Now, most of their relatives and neighbors were planning to bulldoze their houses.  Nate and Kim wanted to save their house and we were there to help them.\r\nThe first thing we did was to take a tour of the house.  My first thoughts as I walked in were "Wow!" and “Gross!”  It amazed me how much damage had been done to the house by the storm.  Since the outside of the house was hardly damaged, I was expecting the inside of the house to be in the same condition.  I could not have been more wrong.  The first thing I saw in the dim light was the couch.  It had mold growing all over it, top to bottom.\r\nAfter the tour, we started the actual work on the house.  Before we could clean the walls, we had to take everything out of the house.  This included furniture, carpets, shelves, counters, and large appliances.  This was the worst part of the vacation for me.  Everything I touched was infested with mold and smelled terrible.  As we carried moldy things out to the street, mold got in our hair and in our clothes.  I bet we didn’t smell that great after a few minutes of this work.  The object that was the most disgusting was the refrigerator.  It had not been cleaned out before the storm.  My mom thought that she saw maggots growing inside.  I didn’t have the courage to open its doors.  As we took the refrigerator out of the kitchen, it started to drip this thick, black ooze.  The ooze smelled so bad that I had to run outside to get a breath of fresh air.\r\nAs we took everything out one by one, Kim and Nate went through the items, deciding if anything could be saved.  Kim carefully washed some of her fine china in bleach.  I remember them saving a picture of Nate''s parents because Nate''s mother was dying of cancer.  Sadly, almost nothing else could be saved.\r\nWhen everything had been taken out, we started our work on the walls.  We first had to take the drywall off.  Fortunately, in most places, the mold  had only gotten four feet up the wall, so we did not have to take off anything higher that that.  I learned to used crowbars and hammers to rip off the drywall.  My favorite tool, though, was the sledgehammer.  Drywall was very crumbly, especially because it was damaged by water, and it got all over the place as we took it down.  This led to a long cleanup before we could go after the plywood.\r\nDuring the week, out of necessity, I learned how walls are put together.  The plywood is located under the drywall.  We had to take all the plywood off so we that we could remove the moldy insulation and wash the studs with bleach.  To take off the plywood, we used many of the same tools as we had used to take off the drywall.  This was the hardest physical work I did in Louisiana.  The plywood had been stapled to the studs with giant staples that proved to be almost impossible to remove.  Sometimes, I didn’t think I had enough strength to get it off.  But we all worked as a team, and somehow, we stripped all the walls down to the studs.\r\nAfter the plywood, we pulled out the moldy insulation and started on the last step, washing down the studs.  The studs are the beams inside the walls  that hold up the house.  They, like everything else in the house, were covered in mold.  We used an incredibly strong bleach solution for this part of the job.  Even this task was time consuming.  There were many studs that made up the house and it took a long time to clean  just one.\r\nBy the time our four days were up, we still had not finished cleaning this one house.  There were two rooms where we still had to clean the studs.  I was disappointed, but, fortunately, another family was staying an extra day and was able to finish the job.\r\nAt night, we stayed at a Lutheran church annex in New Iberia, Louisiana.  We slept in bunk beds that had been made by Mennonites who had come down earlier to help out.  This was an improvement as we were originally told that we would be sleeping on air mattresses on the floor.  It almost felt like we were staying at a summer camp.\r\nWe worked hard, but the week was also filled with fun.  The kids realized, much to the chagrin of our parents, that fireworks were legal in Louisiana.  We went out, bought some fireworks, and set them off, almost killing our parents in the process.  To get back at us, our parents replaced the fluff in out peanut butter and fluff sandwiches with vanilla cake icing.\r\nThe Jewish community was very kind and helpful to us while we were in Louisiana.  Three of the four nights that we were there, people invited us to dinner at their homes.  Being with them made me realize that taking this trip during the Jewish holiday of Chanukah was very symbolic.  Centuries ago, the Jews were cleaning out their temple during Chanukah after it had been destroyed by the Romans.  In Louisiana, our group was cleaning out houses that had been damaged by the hurricane.  A local Jewish family even gave us presents.  The gift bags were filled with mini Tabasco bottles, which are made locally, home-made praelines, and other Louisiana treats.  This made me feel very connected to the Jewish community there.\r\nWe also went to a Cajun restaurant in Lafayette.  It had a live band playing and served authentic Cajun food.  The fiddle player looked just like Mr. Golden, my science teacher from 7th grade.   The restaurant also had a live web-cam and I was able to waive to my dad and my brother back home.  I had some chicken with Cajun spices and it was delicious.  I shied away, though, from the fried alligator.  My mom said that it tasted like chicken.\r\nOne of the things that touched me most about this trip happened on the second day.  All the moldy trash had been piled up on the side of the road.  A couple in a beat up pickup truck stopped in front of the house.  They were wearing worn-out clothes.  They started carefully going through the things that we were planning to throw out and putting them in their truck.  We told them that the objects were unsafe, but they said, “This is better than what we have.”  It was hard for me to imagine being as poor as they were, but they were standing in front of me and I felt helpless.\r\nThis week in Louisiana changed my life in many ways.  I learned that physical objects do not have much value in life.  A very poor, elderly woman said, “I never thought of myself as someone who held on to things, but I guess the Lord is teaching me that things are still important to me.”  It also surprised me how optimistic people were, even after losing their houses and all their possessions.  They seemed not to care much about those kind of things anymore.\r\nI also  kept on thinking of a quote by Joshua Heschel, a well-known Rabbi.  As he marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., he said, “I was praying with my feet.”  This trip felt the same way to me.  By helping out, I was praying with my hands.\r\nI hope to take another vacation of this sort in the near future.  There are still many people in Louisiana that need help.  Many of them feel that they have been forgotten.  This trip was one of the most important experiences I have ever had because it opened up my eyes to the needs of those people.   I believe that it changed me and made me a better person.\r\n');

The house that I worked on had not been touched for 4 months.  It was owned by an unemployed truck driver and his pregnant wife.  The entire house looked like it was destroyed.  It was filled with moldy furniture, mice and insects.  The smell was awful, especially the stench from the refrigerator that hadn''t been cleaned out before the storm.  As we carried moldy furniture, clothes and carpet out to the street, mold got in our hair and in our clothes.  Almost nothing could be saved.\r\n\r\nWe removed the dry wall and plywood off of walls.  We even took off tiles and kitchen cabinets.  I learned how to use a crowbar, but my favorite was a sledgehammer.  Sometimes, I didn''t think I had enough strength to get a plywood off.  But we all worked as a team, and somehow, we stripped all the walls down to the studs.\r\n\r\nWe worked hard, but the week was also filled with fun. Our group had 8 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 16.  We all got along well and played games at night.  We found out, much to our parents'' chagrin, that fireworks were legal in Louisiana.  We also found out, much to our chagrin, that some parents like to play jokes with our peanut butter sandwiches.\r\n\r\nJewish families in the area welcomed us.  For three of the nights there, local Jewish families invited us over for dinner at their homes.  They were very kind and it was nice to feel connected to the Jewish community there.  I also had fun listening to a woman who looked just like my Aunt Ida, speaking with a very heavy New Orleans accent.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that many religious groups had come through and offered help to this area.  During the trip, our Jewish group stayed in a Lutheran church annex.  We slept on bunk beds built by Mennonites.  We used tools bought by a grant from Reform Jews in the DC area.  We cleaned homes using buckets provided by the Mormons.  Unfortunately, we heard that very little help was being provided by FEMA.  Many of the local families also had no insurance or very little insurance.  \r\n\r\nThe hardest part of the week was not the physical work.   On the second day, as we removed more moldy things from the house, a beat up truck drove up to the curve.  A couple came out of the truck and started going through the moldy trash.  Their clothes looked old and shabby. They carefully combed through the things that we had thrown out.  We said, “Sir, they are not safe.”  But, they replied, “This is better than what we have.” I can''t imagine being so poor.  But there they were and I felt helpless. \r\n	\r\nIt seemed fitting that we were cleaning these houses during Chanukah.  As Jews thousands of years ago cleaned the Temple, we were cleaning homes.  I can also understand the hope that those Jews felt when they found a small vial of oil that lasted for 8 days.  Every little thing that we did that week seem to give more and more hope to these homeowners.  A man told us that we were the answers to his wife''s prayers. \r\n\r\nSometimes, I get very wrapped up in getting gifts for Chanuka.  All my Christian friends have the same problem with Christmas.   In Erath, I was spending a week with people who had lost everything.  One elderly woman said, “You know,  I never thought of myself as someone who held onto things, but I guess the Lord is teaching me a lesson that things are still important to me.”\r\n\r\nAfter 4 days of work, we were only able to clean a small number of houses.  Thousands of families are still looking for help.  Many of them think that they''ve been forgotten.\r\n\r\nI would like to go back and help more people.  And, next time, I hope you will join me.  \r\n\r\nShabbat shalom.  \r\n');

Thanks to the support of the United Jewish Communities, 111 Hillel students and fifteen staff members were able to complete meaningful volunteer work in Biloxi, Mississippi.  Over winter break, January 1 – 15, 2006, college students from across North America worked hard to help repair the lives of those devastated by Hurricane Katrina.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK\r\n\r\nEast Biloxi, along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.  Not only was it hit by 140 mph winds, but it was also flooded by the water surge generated by the hurricane.  Homes, businesses, churches - all had 7 to 10 feet of water submerge their belongings, merchandise, and pews.  A fraction of those had flood insurance, some because they could not afford it, many because they were past the official flood plains.  Those that did have flood insurance did not receive enough reimbursement to rebuild a new home.\r\n\r\nThe Westminster Presbyterian Church, under the auspices of the Presbyterian Disaster Assistance, focused its energies and expertise on replacing roofs for home owners meeting unmet needs requirements.  Once a new roof is on a home, the home’s owner can begin to refurbish the inside of their stripped homes.  The church was able to supply the expertise and guidance, but did not have sufficient volunteers for the physical labor of installing new roofs on homes.  Hillel’s student volunteers were a necessity to complete the process that the church had begun.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival to the church, students underwent basic training on the proper use of nail guns and ladder safety.  Each morning, students were on the road by 7:30am, and in two teams of seven (including 2 Hillel staff) traveled to a house.  They set up their equipment, stripped the roof of the old shingles and felt, laid new felt, and put new shingles on the roof.  Depending on the size of roof and its complexities, a roof took 2 – 4 days to complete.  Students learned each process as they went, thus becoming much more efficient by their second house.  Over the two weeks, Hillel students and staff put roofs on 14 homes – the equivalent of 21,000 square feet of shingles.  Miss Paulette, one home owner, watched the process each day, even admiring the students’ work when they weren’t there.  She shared, “The neighbors are going to think I’m crazy because I’m out here each day crying with happiness.”   The work that students completed looked professional, met the highest construction standards, and was done with care and dedication.  Pearce Sunderland, Westminster project coordinator, wrote, “I was especially proud of the last day of week 2.  Your teams stuck with us to the last possible minute before having to return to the church. Due to that fact we were able to complete every project we started!!!!!  I look forward to your return, you are always welcome in " Our Home"..”\r\n\r\nSTUDENTS\r\n\r\nStudents from 16 campus Hillels participated in the Katrina Winter Break over the 2 weeks.  There were a total of 126 participants from all of the schools.  Participation was somewhat lower than expected because of the quick turn around time campus staff had in recruiting individuals right before exams and winter break began.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the students and staff, we had several guests join the program:  Bert Goldberg, President, National Jewish and Family Child Services; Mort Lowenthal, co-chair of Tzedek Hillel; Rabbi Jill Jacobs, educator at Jewish Funds for Justice, and Amy Schrager, Program Director at American Jewish World Service.  \r\n\r\nPARTNER\r\n\r\nThe Westminster Presbyterian Church, as part of the Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA), was an excellent partner.  The church has embraced its mission to be focused on the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast.  They have wisely chosen an area of expertise, roofing, that they can offer to the community.  No other group has yet tackled roofing as a project, making the church’s efforts that much more needed and significant.  The church and PDA are also spearheading the revitalization of the Interfaith Disaster Task Force (IDTF).  Under the chairmanship of Pastor Eddie Hartwell, the goal of IDTF is to bring together different faith organizations working on disaster rebuilding in a coordinated manner so that there is a smooth flow from roofing, to rebuilding internal walls, to electrical wiring, etc.  With their vision, dedication and leadership, they will undoubtedly succeed.\r\n\r\nNEXT STEPS – SPRING 2006\r\n\r\nAfter the overwhelming success of the Katrina Winter Break, Hillel is already planning Katrina Relief Alternative Spring Break.  Thirty campuses have already signed on, with the initial count being 300 participants.  Hillel would like to increase the number of participants to 400, dependent on funding sources, logistics, and student availability.  \r\n\r\nKatrina Relief Alternative Spring Break will run in one-week increments from March 12 through April 2, 2006.  The largest group of campuses, from March 19 – 26, will return to Westminster Presbyterian Church and continue to do roofing projects.  We learned over winter break that additional leaders with construction background will be helpful in the process of teaching and problem-solving on difficult roofing areas, as well as in handling power saws, which Hillel participants are not allowed to use. This valuable lesson will be implemented during the Spring Break program. \r\n\r\nDetails of placement for the first and last week are still being finalized.  One week may be in New Orleans, and the final week may continue with Presbyterian Disaster Assistance on roofing, but in a new area of the county where Hillel worked in over winter break.  Hillel is currently in conversation with all of these potential partners and is determining what sites will meet the two-pronged test: impactful work and meeting the logistical requirements of housing and feeding numerous volunteers.   As the final arrangements are have not been finalized, lodging costs have been budgeted higher than actual from winter break, as our new partners may have higher lodging costs.\r\n\r\nAs a response to the lead gift by United Jewish Communities, several other donors and foundations have provided grants for Katrina Alternative Spring Break.  Please find the winter and spring budget attached.  To achieve success in the upcoming spring break, Hillel is requesting funding from United Jewish Communities for direct relief work, including cost of work materials, food, lodging, and on-site transportation.\r\n\r\nHillel respectfully requests from the United Jewish Communities a grant of $79,820 for Hillel to continue its work in the Gulf Coast over spring break 2006.\r\n\r\n \r\nKATRINA WINTER BREAK PARTICIPATING HILLELS\r\n\r\nJanuary 1 – 8, 2006\r\n\r\nHillel of Broward and Palm Beach\r\nHillel of Greater Toronto\r\nNorth Carolina Hillel\r\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\r\nUniversity of Georgia\r\nUniversity of Michigan\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\r\n\r\nJanuary 8 – 15, 2006\r\n\r\nBerkeley Hillel\r\nBinghamton University\r\nBrandeis University\r\nBronfman Center at New York University\r\nColumbia/Barnard/JTS Hillel\r\nCornell University\r\nWesleyan Jewish Community Hillel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nENDING AND BEGINNING\r\n \r\n\r\nSHINGLING\r\n');

The trip was sponsored by JCRC, through TELEM: Jewish Youth Making a Difference, the service learning program for teens launched in Fall 2005. Along with regular weekly service opportunities throughout the academic year, TELEM offers immersion experiences in community service. A trip to Honduras is being planned for February break, in conjunction with the American Jewish World Service. The trip to Louisiana was a pilot trip, the first of its kind in this community (as far as we know) to engage families in an intensive service experience together. We have learned from the Jewish Coalition for Service ( a national umbrella group) that family service trips is the single most requested program (a request which up to now has not been able to be filled).\r\n\r\nWe contacted the Jewish Community Relations Council of New Orleans, whose staff provided invaluable support in vetting and connecting us with an appropriate local organizational partner, in assisting with a range of logistics and in connecting us with the local Jewish community. We partnered with the Southern Mutual Help Association, http://southernmutualhelp.org/index.cfm an organization with a 36 year old track record of “build(ing) build rural communities through people''s growth in their own empowerment and the just management of resources”. In keeping with its mission, SMHA is playing a key role in the recovery and long-term development of hurricane-ravaged areas of South Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe group consisted of 9 teens and 8 parents. The families were from Newton and Needham and they belonged to Temple Emanuel and Hillel B’nai Torah. The teens ranged from 13 – 19 (though most were in the 15-16 year range), one was a Prozdor graduate and all but one of the remaining teens were current Prozdor students. The last teen was a participant in TELEM through the JCC’s Teens for Tzedek. The parents were from a range of professions, including law, clinical psychology, health consultation, human rights and Jewish community work.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Baton Rouge on the evening of 12/25 and were greeted by a young woman from the New Orleans federation (assigned to this work by the CRC director) who greeted us and led us on the 90-minute drive to our temporary home, (the community center of a Methodist church, newly outfitted with bunk beds!). This gracious young woman stocked the center with groceries for us and arranged to have a hot vegetarian meal waiting for us on our arrival.\r\n\r\nWe lit candles together for the first night of Chanukah and reflected on the relevant holiday themes. Chanukah (or “Dedication”) recalls a time in Jewish history when, following our victory over Syrian domination, our ancestors removed impurities from the Temple, restored its sacred character and reclaimed it once again, as our home. This would form the basis of our work with those in Louisiana whose homes were rendered uninhabitable by hurricanes.\r\n\r\nPrior to beginning our work, we were oriented and trained by the staff of SMHA. We were cautioned in particular, to protect ourselves from exposure to mold, and were provided with masks and gloves which were to be worn at all times when inside the affected houses. SMHA staff described their work, of assessing the needs of local homeowners and prioritizing those in dire financial straits as well as those with particular health issues. These are the homeowners that SMHA has targeted for their volunteer efforts (having deployed 150 volunteers thus far in response to the hurricane).\r\n\r\nOver the next few days, we split into 2 or 3 teams each day, working on houses in the towns of Erath and Delcambre. With median household incomes of just over $27,000, these are town with incomes, household values and education levels significantly below the state average. The families we encountered were shocked and traumatized by the extent of the hurricane damage and on their own, had been unable to do the necessary work to move on with their lives.\r\n\r\nOne team worked all four days on one house, since it required the most extensive work. It was owned by Nate, a truck driver who was laid off prior to the hurricane and his wife Kim, who discovered that she was pregnant right after Nate lost his job. Due to Kim’s pregnancy, she had been unable to even enter her own house after the storm (exposure to mold being too risky). Since Nate couldn’t possibly tackle the job on his own, the house remained sealed up and unattended, locked behind their ornate door, now characterized by FEMA markings (signifying the extent of damage and marking the number of bodies found – in this case, thankfully zero). The entire group entered the house together on that first day as part of our orientation and encountered an unimaginable scene. At the height of the hurricane, the house was filled with 6 feet of water so almost all of the contents were rendered unsalvageable (not only furniture and appliances, but clothing and all other personal items). The kitchen was filled with roaches, mice and maggots. Walls and floors were saturated with toxic mold and had to be removed. By the end of the four days, dry wall and insulation were removed and the house was stripped to studs.\r\n\r\nKim and Nate were with us throughout the work, Nate joining us in the demolition work inside and Kim, remaining outside, selecting and cleaning the few items of sentimental value that could be salvaged (a family Bible, a portrait of Nate’s parents, including his mother who was now dying of cancer, a disease that seems to disproportionately afflict this community). When asked how she’s gotten through all of this, Kim attributed her survival to “faith and family.  Nate regaled us with proud descriptions of his various hobbies, Cajun music and cooking. He then asked about us. When he learned that we were Jewish, he was dumbfounded. Over and over again he repeated, “But I thought that Jews only helped other Jews”. He expressed amazement that we would travel across the country to help him, who we had never met. He then proceeded to ask many questions about our practices and our lives. What are our services like – revivals? Do we use music? And what do we do for a living in Boston, since the winters are cold? Is there plant work available? Neither he nor Kim had been out of the South before and they were fascinated by us. Our relationship deepened over the days, as we worked and lunched on our peanut butter sandwiches together. Nate expressed endless gratitude, repeatedly offering to cook us some of his specialties (he was baffled by our dietary restrictions!) When it was finally time to say goodbye, Nate acknowledged that shortly after the hurricane, when he found himself homeless, unemployed and with a pregnant wife, he felt despondent and even considered suicide. He told us that Kim prayed to God and now we he was convinced, we were angels who had been sent to them in response. He was also grateful that he was about to start a new truck driving job. Unfortunately, they have no insurance to help them recoup their losses (their flood insurance covers structural damage only).\r\n\r\nOther groups worked in several other houses, one of a man with Lupus and still another, of a man who developed a staph infection from the mold and was unable to return to his house. The teams worked diligently to remove damage but to salvage all that was possible, both to spare the homeowners unnecessary expense and to preserve memories (one team was careful to cut out a section of a bedroom wall with a young child’s growth chart before demolishing the rest).\r\n\r\nSeveral of us spent the last 2 days working on the home of an elderly widow. As we stripped layers of wallpaper and linoleum, we were able to get a sense of the family that lived there. Toward the end of the second day, “Miss Ethel” arrived to visit, brought by a volunteer. As soon as she stepped out of the car, her eyes welled up with tears. She said that she had attempted to enter the house twice before but each time, felt so discouraged and depressed that she was ready to give up on the idea of ever returning. “But now that I hear the sound of hammers in my home, I can feel hope again”, she told us. She repeatedly marveled, “I had no idea this existed in this world. I didn’t know there were people like you!” She slowly took us through her house (reluctantly complying with our demand that she don a mask!) telling us stories about the pots of gumbo she made for hundreds of people, about the disabled grandchildren she raised and the other hardships she endured. But mostly she expressed pride and gratitude and exuded unending strength. Before she left, she glanced back at her now empty and stripped home and said, “You know, I never thought of myself as someone who held on to things. But I guess the Lord is teaching me a lesson that things were still too important to me. That’s alright – it’s never too late to learn a lesson”. We learned that Miss Ethel had no insurance at all and that the $5000 that she would receive from FEMA would not be likely to even cover the cost of the raising of her house to newly mandated heights.\r\n\r\nOften we went to neighbor’s houses, to see if anyone had a usable bathroom or tools to loan. Always we were greeted with warmth and graciousness and inevitably we heard more stories of misfortune and deprivation. Miss Ethel’s neighbor suffered a stroke several months earlier, while she was repairing plumbing under her daughter’s floor. The boards had to be cut away to rescue her. While she was in the hospital, her husband rode his motorbike to visit her and was killed in an accident. She now spent her time in a chair on the porch of her trailer, gazing at her now uninhabitable home. We did all that we could, filling out an intake form, hoping to secure services for her through SMHA.\r\n\r\nWherever we turned, we encountered hard working people, just struggling to survive. It soon became clear that although the hurricane may have unraveled the fabric of people’s lives, the poverty that so many of them endured was entrenched and multi-generational. We witnessed one particularly heart wrenching moment at Nate and Kim.s house, after we had hauled our the ruined contents of their home and deposited an enormous mound of rubble in front of their house. An older black couple came by with their truck and spent the next several hours methodically going through the moldy debris, periodically placing random items on their truck. When asked if they were hit hard by the hurricane, they nonchalantly replied that they had not been affected. It was clear that they were simply part of a large underclass, whose struggle for survival is not seasonal or temporary.\r\n\r\nOur group was supported and nurtured through this work by the extraordinarily gracious local Jewish community. We were hosted for dinner on three of the four nights we worked, twice by members of the New Iberia synagogue (which consists of 30 households) and on our last night, by the family of our young Federation liaison, members of the synagogue in Lafayette. On our last evening when we lit candles, we drew once again from the wisdom of our tradition. We recalled the Hasidic story about the rabbi who posed the question to his students about when night ends and day begins. His students wondered, is it when you can differentiate between a dpg and a sheep? No, answered the rabbi. How about when you can tell the difference between a fig and a peach tree? Once again, the rabbi said no. The students pressed him  - so how can you tell when night ends and day begins? The rabbi responded, it is when you look at the face of any man, woman or child and can see that it is your brother or sister. During our time in Louisiana, we encountered people who seemed nothing like us – who spoke differently and lived lives foreign to our own. But as we worked in their houses, they began to feel like our own homes and soon, the owners grew to feel  like our own families, like our brothers and sister, parents and grandparents. This was one of the many profound lessons we learned during our time down South.\r\n\r\nThe group came away from this experience both sobered by what we saw – and energized to maintain a helping connection to this community and these people. The needs are endless. There are hundreds more families waiting for help from volunteers to remove the toxins from their homes. The work of rebuilding may be even more daunting, given the lack of resources to do so. In addition to coordinating the volunteer effort, SMHA provides grants to homeowners without resources to rebuild. Our group’s work will continue from Boston – to spread the word about the devastation in rural Louisiana (not just New Orleans) to encourage other volunteers to go and to raise funds to support the critical work of SMHA.\r\n');

Rather a fair share dues system will be enacted.\r\nIn addition our Jewish Federation personnel will be authorized to pursue\r\nthose who are delinquent or wish to make pledges.\r\nGlobal harmony may be a bit of a challenge. We will recruit the major world\r\nreligious leaders to put their heads together. Have you noticed that many of\r\nthem are already wearing head covering? I believe the Pope may have attended\r\na girl?s Bat Mitzvah, since his is often red, except on yuntif, when it is white.\r\nI look forward to working with all of you for this international outreach program.\r\nHappy Purim,\r\nYour Strange Rabbi\r\nShabbat Terumah\r\nFriday, March 3\r\n6:15 Tot Shabbat\r\n7:15 Family Shabbat led by GoPTY\r\nSaturday, March 4\r\n10:30 Shabbat Worship and\r\nTorah Discussion\r\nShabbat Zachor\r\nFriday, March 10\r\n8:00 Evening Worship\r\nSermon: Dealing With Angry Feelings\r\nSaturday, March 11\r\n10:30 Morning Worship and\r\nTorah Discussion\r\nPurim\r\nMonday, March 13\r\n7:00 Megillah Reading and\r\nPurim Shpiel\r\n?The Megillah According to the Beatles?\r\nShabbat Parah\r\nFriday, March 17\r\n8:00 Hadassah Shabbat\r\nSermon: What Now For Israel?\r\nSaturday, March 18\r\n10:30 Morning Worship and\r\nTorah Discussion\r\nShabbat Hachodesh\r\nFriday, March 24\r\n8:00 Evening Worship\r\n?Taking Stock of Where We Are?\r\nOneg in honor of\r\nThe Bat Mitzvah of Rachel Mann\r\nSaturday, March 25\r\n10:30 Morning Worship\r\nBat Mitzvah of Rachel Mann,\r\ndaughter of Tara and David Mann\r\nShabbat Vayikra\r\nFriday, March 31\r\n8:00 Evening Worship\r\n?International Jewish Music Festival?\r\nOneg in honor of\r\nThe Bar Mitzvah of Jacob Ross\r\nSaturday, April 1\r\n10:30 Morning\r\nBar Mitzvah of Jacob Ross,\r\nson of Shelly and Bob Ross\r\nFIRST FRIDAY\r\nMarch 3\r\nOnce again we offer two services on the\r\nfirst Friday of the month.\r\n6:15 Tot Shabbat-\r\nPurim will be coming and the Tots of\r\nNursery School age are invited to come and\r\nstart preparing for this joyous holiday.

NEWS!\r\nTHE BEATLES WERE JEWISHNEW\r\nMUSIC DISCOVERED\r\nMuch to the amazement of music historians\r\nit has recently been revealed that the\r\nBeatles, John, Paul, George and Ringo,\r\nwere all Jewish. Though reputed to be from\r\nLiverpool, they were really from Golders\r\nGreen, a Jewish section of London. Their\r\nHebrew names were Yonatan, Shaul,\r\nChaim and Kochav.\r\nThe new music discovered seems to\r\nbe some sort of Purim parody. To hear this\r\nnewly recovered musical history, all are\r\ninvited to Gates of Prayer on Monday\r\nevening March 13 at 7:00. The ?Megillah\r\nAccording to the Beatles? is for music lovers\r\nof all ages.\r\nJEWISH MEDITATION\r\nWith Rabbi Stan Zamek\r\nFour Wednesdays ? 8:00\r\nBeginning March 15\r\nThere are various ways to cope with the\r\nstress that so many of us are feeling.

Sherri has been an active\r\nmember of the Jewish community since\r\nher arrival in Metairie many years ago.\r\nShe served as President of Gates of\r\nPrayer?s Sisterhood from 2001 to 2003.\r\nIn addition she serves on the Board of\r\nTrustees and is currently Co-Chair of the\r\nWorship Committee.\r\nSherri is multi-talented. She has led\r\nworship and sings in Kol Simcha the\r\nGates of Prayer Volunteer Choir.

Rabbi Black has been honored as one of the ?Top\r\nTen Artists? in both the categories of ?Jewish Children?s Music? and ?Male, Adult\r\nContemporary Jewish Music? by Moment magazine and TARA Publications. He has\r\nrecorded four critically acclaimed albums of Jewish music: Leave a Little Bit Undone,\r\nAleph Bet Boogie, Everybody?s Got A Little Music and Sabbatical.\r\nJoy in the experience of learning. That?s a big part of Rabbi Joe Black?s approach to\r\ncontemporary Jewish music. With children, he is energetic, surprising, and dynamic.\r\nWith adults, his superb musicianship and sense of spiritual awareness creates an\r\nopportunity for the head and the heart to come together.

The merchandise\r\nhas been packed up and will be stored until\r\nour gift shop is ready to reopen. Passover\r\nitems for sale will be on display in the window\r\nin the temple lobby. We are working\r\nhard to open as soon as possible.\r\n?Welcome Back Gates of Prayer? was a\r\ntremendous success. Thank you to Susan\r\nScharff and Shirley Merlin for setting up the\r\nevening, and all the wonderful Sisterhood\r\nmembers who donated food.\r\nI attended a leadership conference in\r\nAtlanta in February. I found it quite eye opening.\r\nEven with all of our Katrina troubles,\r\nwe are still a lot better off than many other\r\nSisterhoods.\r\nWe will have eight Sisterhood members\r\nattend the WRJ District 15 Biennial in Memphis,\r\nwhere we will cheer on Sherri Tarr as\r\nshe is installed as the new District President!\r\nMark your calendars for our upcoming\r\nevents.

But I\r\nthink something extraordinary has happened\r\nto us, to our community and to our\r\nsynagogue. We came home to rebuild our\r\nlives, our city and our Temple. We are a\r\ntestament to what can be done in a short\r\nperiod of time without governmental interference,\r\nwhich we all know is a disaster in\r\nitself. We are here to show the community\r\nand the world that even under the most\r\ndire circumstances we continue to be a\r\nvibrant part of our community, rebuilding\r\nour lives and rebuilding our Jewish home.\r\nBecause of what Gates of Prayer has\r\ngone through we are establishing a new\r\ncommittee called the Katrina Response\r\nCommittee. We will look at how we prepared\r\nfor this storm and how we can do\r\nbetter in the future. The committee will\r\ngather information from all our\r\ncongregants so that we will be able to communicate\r\nand locate everyone in the event\r\nof another evacuation. Plans will be formalized\r\nin helping our congregants evacuate;\r\nwe will see what our congregants need\r\nnow and most importantly how can we help\r\nour community rebuild. If you would like to\r\nbe a member of this most important committee\r\nplease e-mail Marc Beerman, chairman\r\nat mbeerman@beerman.com\r\nOn a lighter note, plan on attending a\r\nconcert given by Rabbi Joe Black on Sunday\r\nMarch 5th at 5pm. Our Purim Shpiel,\r\n?The Megillah According to the Beatles,? will\r\nbe on Monday, March 13th. Look for more\r\ninformation in the bulletin. And mark April\r\n8th in your calendars for our ?Laugh Out\r\nLoud? gala with special entertainment by\r\nHarry Anderson and dinner by Royal China.\r\nInvitations will soon be going out ? this is\r\nsomething you really don?t want to miss!!\r\nBrotherhood held Bingo on Saturday,\r\nFebruary 4, 2006 and everyone had a great\r\ntime.

Tears wanting to come, because I knew that the experience had to come to a close, the feeling that the work of my hands was truly needed would have to end.  I never expected the circumstances on Hillel''s Katrina Relief Alternative Break to be so unique and meaningful.   I was one of one hundred North American Jewish students from several universities who took part in a one week initiative to reach out to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  We were trained in one day to build and repair roofs.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life, I felt that I had truly made a difference in the lives of specific individuals.  Driving down Highway 90, the Gulf Coast was on one side of us, and complete destruction on the other.  Everything from the local Waffle House to people''s homes was gutted from the inside, if not completely destroyed.  Anyone passing what we witnessed would yearn to help out in some way; Hillel gave us the opportunity to fulfill that yearning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis Katrina relief project differed from other community service projects I''ve taken part in.  As a Bat-Mitzvah project, I started an initiative called "Bear-ey Blessed," in which I collected teddy-bears from companies and individuals, in order to deliver them to children in both American and Israeli hospitals.  The teddy-bears warmed hearts and gave children hope; however my experience in Biloxi was an entirely new and different type of help. I worked long, physically strenuous days with passionate Jewish students from all over the country, building new roofs and interacting with members of the local community.  We slept on Westminster Presbyterian Church''s pews and floor.  I participated in something huge; I took part in an essential step in providing these people with shelter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI never expected that the deepest of friendship would come from this one week experience.  I love the people I worked roofs with; together every morning, we silently drove down Highway 90, praying for restoration and better lives for the residents.  Every day as a group, we also felt pride that we were doing everything humanly in our power to help rebuild.  We shared our life-goals, feelings and desires with one another; students and staff articulated ideas and past experiences.  Our physical labor was always initiated as a team, and our roofs became our own as we gave everything we had.  Each night after dinner, we evaluated our Judaism, our faith, and the meaning of our participation on the trip.   Beyond our accomplishments and friendships, we built one of the most beautiful pluralistic and understanding Jewish communities I''ve ever encountered.  People inspired me, and I never thought I''d be told that I too was an inspiration to others.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring this Katrina Relief opportunity, I constantly considered what it meant to be universally human, while at the same time redefined with my peers what it meant to be distinctively Jewish.  Whether the participants chose to consider themselves obligated as Jews to help the victims of the Katrina disaster, or simply wanted to be there, each student chose to take part in the rebuilding.  The home owners did not owe us anything for the assistance we gave them, and we did not owe them anything-this to me was one of the most human elements of the experience.  It didn''t matter what race, religion or economic category these people came from; we simply wanted to do our part in helping our fellow man.  At the same time, during organized programs, we took time to evaluate what the experience meant to us as Jews.  We coordinated and took part in Shabbat together, debriefing on the destruction we saw, and the hope that was built by our work.  There is no one that I spoke with who did not wish that this experience could have lasted longer, that we could have done more... because there was something about the experience as a whole that made us feel whole as people.

JCRC set us up with the Southern Mutual Help Association, a group that is playing a key role in the recovery and long-term development of hurricane-ravaged areas of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nWhat made us embark on this journey? It sure wasn’t the sleeping arrangements – all of us in one room trying to block out the snoring of some of our bunk mates. \r\nIt sure wasn’t the dust, mold, and fumes that would require us to wear specialized and uncomfortable masks while we worked in the heat of the day. \r\nAnd it sure wasn’t the back strain that some of us older folks endured from hauling soggy carpeting. \r\nInstead, it was a desire to demonstrate to our children that they, too, can have an impact on the world…A desire to do something useful, as adults, other than write a check, for people we knew relatively little about but needed a whole lot of help… And, as we heard from Rabbi Gardenswartz, a desire to pray with our feet. \r\n\r\nWhat made our work successful? Alex hit the nail on the head, (so to speak).  It was our team work, the power of community. While we were considered “unskilled labor” who were fairly useless as individuals, we managed, when brought together, to accomplish in a few days what would have taken months, if not years, for the homeowners to handle themselves, or would never have happened.  \r\n\r\nHow was it that four of the seven families are members of Temple Emanuel?\r\nAll had embarked on a previous journey – spending the weekend together with other families on a Shabbat retreat through the religious school. The relationships were born a few years ago during that other “camp- like” experience and now, the power of community that was then, has broadened its meaning.\r\n\r\nIt was particularly apt that our work took place during Chanukah.  Alex pointed out the parallels of the Jews cleaning out the impurities in the Temple thousands of years ago and our cleaning out the uninhabitable homes in Louisiana. So, too, were the parallels evident in the popular Israeli Chanukah song, \r\nBanu hoshech l’garesh, \r\nbyadaynu or v’aish. \r\nKol echad hoo or katan\r\nVkulanu or aitan\r\n\r\nTogether we have come to rid the darkness\r\nAlone we are but one small light\r\nTogether, we can make that one light \r\n    shine strong and bright.\r\n\r\nShabbat Shalom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n');

It gives you the leverage to pull out panels and moldings, the heft to smash wallboard, and a claw to pull nails.  And, if you are willing to learn how, you can pray with it.  \r\n\r\nI spent Christmas week in Louisiana with my son Isaac, repairing homes in the area ravaged by Hurricane Rita.  Our group consisted of eight adults and nine of their kids, all Jews from the Greater Boston area who came together through the Jewish Community Relations Council and TELEM: Jewish Youth Making a Difference.  \r\n\r\nHave you heard about Rita?  Her big sister Katrina had quite the coming out party in New Orleans.  It made a big splash and was covered in all the papers. Such a shame about her poor sister Rita.  She had her party way out in the swamps and hardly anybody noticed.   Like rival sisters, the devastations of New Orleans and Bayou country might vie for attention.  But it is no contest.  Millions have visited New Orleans and have an emotional connection with the city.  It was devastated in indisputably dramatic fashion.   The Cajun country devastated by Rita is a relatively forgotten corner where volunteer relief work is desperately needed.\r\n\r\nWe were greeted by Judy, with the Southern Mutual Help Association, an agency coordinating disaster relief in the area.  Judy asked us each to explain why we had come.  One member of the group told the story of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who had marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. at Selma.  Heschel said that as he marched he “felt as though his legs were praying.”  The concept of prayerful action would become the theme for the week.   \r\n\r\nOur crew consisted of three parents, three teens and a young woman named Danette.  The work entailed cleaning out homes that had been flooded.  The waters had subsided, but the homes were uninhabitable due to mold, ruined electrical wiring, and destroyed furniture.  Once the house was empty, you could start pulling out the carpets, linoleum, paneling, walls and insulation to prepare it for de-molding.  \r\n\r\nWhile in Louisiana I met six homeowners who had been flooded out of their houses, four of them over the age of 70.  Not one of them complained.  All were stoic and resolute in the face of tragedy.  One homeowner told us, “I knew Jews liked to help but I thought they only helped other Jews.”  Perhaps we were repairing more than houses.\r\n\r\nThe last home we worked on was owned by a 73 year old woman the neighbors referred to as “Miss Ethel”.  “Miss” was said with affection and respect and, as best I could tell, was used only for women who had achieved a certain age.  \r\n\r\nIn those last days we progressed from prying with a crowbar to praying with one.\r\n\r\nThis kind of prayer is very effective in groups of two.  You have a companion to assist you when you hit spiritual roadblocks like a recalcitrant molding or a dead animal hidden behind a panel.  Danette took a more monastic approach.  She would park herself in a room and methodically pry and scrape till it was cleansed.\r\n\r\nMiss Ethel visited us on our final day of work.  Tears welled up in her eyes (and ours) as she blessed us repeatedly.  She came into the house and where we feared she would see destruction (for we had near gutted that house from four feet down to the floor), she saw hope.  She told us of her daughter and her two disabled kids, the catering she used to do out of her kitchen, the room her granddaughter had marked with girlhood graffiti.  She stood in her ravaged home and said, “I thought I had learned to let go of everything but I guess I needed to learn a little more, so God sent this flood to teach me.”\r\n\r\nAfter she left we worked with renewed purpose, racing against the fading light.  We were doing this for Miss Ethel.  And it was with sadness that we gathered our tools at the end of the day.  \r\n\r\nSoon we were home, trying to convey to our families the spiritual journey we had just taken.  How we had gone to Louisiana to give but had instead received, how we had met people poor in possessions but rich in resolve and how, as Rabbi Heschel would have understood, there is more than one way to use a crowbar. \r\n\r\n');

Our evacuees have returned to their homes. \r\n\r\nAll but one. My dad will never see New Orleans again. \r\n\r\nOur family’s hurricane story began like everyone else’s. My parents, Fred and Cathy Kahn, veterans of Betsy, Camille, and myriad storms over the years, were cavalier about the threat of Katrina. They evacuated New Orleans last year when Ivan sent residents fleeing into a nightmare of gridlock on the interstates. Fourteen hours bumper-to-bumper on the usual two-hour trip to New Iberia made them far more leery of the traffic than the hurricane bearing down on New Orleans. As the storm grew in strength and took aim at the Crescent City, they finally packed up the car with an overnight bag and my father’s medications and came “out west,” as my dad called New Iberia. \r\n\r\nThis was not an easy trip. My mother is 75, my dad 82. Daddy had his heart valves replaced in 2000. That gave him four good years, but in the past year he had two near-fatal bouts of endocarditis, a bacterial infection of the heart. Because his taxed heart valves weren’t pumping enough oxygen, he used a breathing machine when he felt like he wasn’t getting enough air. He was also beginning to show signs of developing Alzheimer’s disease. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, despite their seven-hour evacuation, my parents arrived in good spirits and my dad greeted me with a cheerful “Hello, Mary,” when he came in the door. In short order my brother-in-law and his wife, Steve and Elizabeth Seebol, childhood friends Peter and Paul Reynaud and their 80-year-old parents Dorothy and Richard Reynaud all turned up on my doorstep before the sun set on Sunday, Aug. 28. I made a vat of gumbo, and we all sat down to dinner. \r\n\r\nThe horror of the week following the storm is engraved on the collective consciousness of every resident of Louisiana. Anger, sorrow, outrage, grief — moods shifted constantly. I went to work at the paper, where people randomly broke down in tears. At home, we lived as if the world were ending, cooking extravagantly and drinking cases of wine to drown the images of a beloved city engulfed by chaos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNew Orleans has an intimate relationship with its dead. Raised tombs resemble houses, and locals mark the passage to a better world with jazz funerals, a final celebration of the life of the deceased. \r\n\r\nHurricane Katrina disrupted those ceremonies. With funeral homes shuttered, cemeteries only now beginning to inter the dead and congregations scattered across the nation, the ritual of burial is another traumatic legacy of the storms. \r\n\r\nAs Katrina hit the city, the business of burying the dead — like every other business — came to a halt. Billy Henry, manager of Bultman Funeral Home on St. Charles Avenue, and his staff stayed though the initial storm. (Bultman is one of four locations owned by Tharp-Sontheimer.) They were forced to evacuate on Thursday, Sept. 1, because of rising water. “Almost every funeral home that had embalming facilities had bodies [awaiting burial],” he says. At its funeral home on Claiborne Avenue, employees carried bodies up to the second floor and left them when they evacuated, hoping floodwaters wouldn’t rise above the first floor. \r\n\r\nAlexander’s Funeral Home in Lutcher, also owned by Tharp-Sontheimer, was able to remain open. Henry went to work there on Friday, Sept. 2. “Just because there was a storm doesn’t mean people stop dying,” Henry says. “The phone began ringing when people found out where we were.” He rented refrigeration equipment to hold bodies because there was nowhere to bury them. \r\n\r\nThe embalmed bodies abandoned in New Orleans were evacuated by airboat the following week. The only functioning cemetery in greater New Orleans was Garden of Memories, on Airline Highway in Kenner. “They were gracious enough to allow us to do temporary burials in their mausoleum,” Henry says. “We’ve just now begun to transfer those caskets to permanent burial places.” \r\n\r\nOthers will never make it home. Legendary musician Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown, already battling lung cancer, fled Katrina by evacuating to Texas. His family said he was heartbroken by the destruction of his Slidell home; the Times-Picayune published a stark photograph of one of Brown’s guitar cases lying amidst the rubble of his house. Brown died Sept. 10 and was buried in his boyhood hometown of Orange, Texas, on Sept. 17. \r\n\r\nRenowned Creole chef Austin Leslie died in Georgia of a heart attack following an arduous evacuation from his home in Gentilly. A funeral service was held in Atlanta, and there was an Oct. 10 second-line parade honoring him in New Orleans. His family hopes to bury him in New Orleans sometime in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father saw his city submerged. The television was never turned off, and we watched in horror as an entire city block burned in my parents’ neighborhood. Through every heart-wrenching image and agonizing revelation, he alone remained cheerful. There comes a peace that accompanies diminishing powers. He sat next to the phone and loved to answer it as his longtime friends — now fellow evacuees scattered across the country — called the house. My mother, overloaded with the level of care my father needed, hired nurses who worked in shifts and became part of the swelling household. Daddy would ask my mother daily when they were going home, and sometimes in frustration, most often with kindness, my mother would tell him, “Freddy, we can’t go home; New Orleans had a flood, remember?” \r\n\r\n“Oh, I remember now,” my dad would say with a rueful smile. But then he’d forget and ask again. \r\n\r\nWhen mold began to consume houses as they emerged from the floodwaters, my mother and I realized that with my dad’s weakened immune system, he would not be able to go home for a long, long time. As the days passed and he became exceedingly frail — eating less, sleeping more — we knew that he probably would never go home at all. Dad was hospitalized with breathing difficulties at Dauterive Hospital in New Iberia when Hurricane Rita hit on Sept. 24. It was a blessing; Rita cut off the power for two days at my house, and Daddy would have been hot, miserable and confused had he been home with us. \r\n\r\nMy brother, Frederic, flew in from Atlanta. We spent two days evaluating my parents’ house in New Orleans. By then, five weeks after Katrina, we knew that the house was growing a toxic garden of mold, and we would have to rake out personal belongings, tear out sheetrock, deal with insurance companies and rebuild if my parents ever wanted to return to their home. While my brother was in town, my dad was released from the hospital. During that time, my father’s doctors, my mom, my brother and I understood that dad would never get well. We only wanted to make his days comfortable. My mother lovingly told him, “You’ll never have to go back to the hospital again.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile mom stayed by my father’s side in New Iberia, my husband, brother and I took on the work of salvaging what was left of my parents’ belongings in New Orleans. We’d make the two-hour drive back, covered with grime, hauling some prize we had found — daddy’s watch, the keys to their bank box, an unopened bottle of scotch. Dad promptly gave his watch to my brother, who burst into tears. \r\n\r\nMy mother was overwhelmed with paperwork. She had to file an insurance claim on their house, keep up with my father’s medical insurance, make sure all the mail came to my house, and transfer power of attorney to herself. She turned her other energies to running my household while everyone else went to work. The heaviest burden, however, was the increasing amount of care my father required and the loneliness and fear my mother experienced, isolated from her friends, her job, her temple and rabbi. \r\n\r\nWe all tried to help, but work offered a stability and normalcy we craved. I found myself spending long hours away from the house. It was hard to watch my father lose control of every aspect of his life, hard to watch my mother try to keep him alive by her will alone. My brother flew home. The Seebols went to stay with Elizabeth’s sister in Atlanta. Members of the Reynaud family returned to New Orleans, to a house virtually undamaged by the storm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 22, I had dawdled in town, unwilling to spend a whole beautiful Saturday at home. I returned at 4 p.m. as Mom and Dad were watching the Tennessee-Alabama football game. Daddy silently slid into unconsciousness, then simply stopped breathing. My mother kept patting his hand and calling his name. \r\n\r\nThere is no preparation for such a moment. My mother and I looked at each other across my father’s still form, then I stood up and put my arms around her. Neither of us cried. We had both cried so many tears for New Orleans that I think we were drained of emotion. The first call was to Hospice, then to a local funeral home we found in the phone book. When the undertaker arrived, my mother gave him my father’s blue blazer with his favorite Andover buttons. She also wanted my father to keep his wedding ring. We watched the hearse pull out of the driveway. \r\n\r\nThe shock was tempered with relief that my dad did not suffer. Tears never came. Instead, we did what we had been doing all along, making plans and decisions. \r\n\r\nNo funeral in New Iberia. \r\n\r\nNo memorial service until my mother was home in New Orleans. \r\n\r\nCremation was the only possibility. \r\n\r\nThat done, we had a drink. \r\n\r\nSunday, we paid the undertaker. My mom called some of her friends, the ones she could find. She realized she had to open a succession for my father’s estate and discovered her lawyers hadn’t returned to New Orleans. Her rabbi was living out of town. The funeral home our family has used for decades had been flooded. The cemetery in New Orleans where the family plot holds the remains of generations of my family was closed. There was nothing more my mother could do for my father. \r\n\r\nBut there was still a lot of work for her. Monday, she went with me to New Orleans to see the city and her house for the first time. Tuesday we went shopping for a new stove, icebox and dishwasher. Wednesday we bought her new clothes — the first time she had been shopping since she arrived with an overnight bag on the eve of the storm. We worked on her insurance claim. She got her hair cut. We went out to dinner. \r\n\r\nNeither of us cried. My mother’s rabbi, Ed Cohn, returned to New Orleans Nov. 13. When I spoke to him about my inability to grieve, he said my reactions weren’t unusual. “Everyone’s shoulders are bearing heavy burdens,” he says. “Everyone is sustaining so many shocks. We just have to cope, push things along.” \r\n\r\nThe week Cohn resumed his duties, he immediately performed three funerals for families in his congregation who had been waiting for him, and one for another congregation. The city’s cemeteries are open again, but on very limited schedules. Only 10 percent of the employees of Lakelawn, Metairie and St. Vincent cemeteries — those who have a place to live — have returned to the city. Burials are limited and have to be scheduled three weeks after the funeral in some cases. \r\n\r\nMy mother returned to New Orleans a month ago. She lives in a borrowed apartment and goes to her job as archivist at Touro Hospital, while her contractor works on her house. Everything has to be rebuilt. She’ll have a new kitchen, new closets, carpets and new clothes. The house is projected to be ready by January if the neighborhood has gas to power her new hot water heater. \r\n\r\nMy mother will move into a house without a trace left of my dad. My father came from a family steeped in ritual; once something is done one way, it is forevermore the only way. Every object held meaning, and nothing was ever discarded. Katrina changed that. Dad’s clothes, frosted with mold, were thrown out months ago. His wooden desk, sitting on a water-saturated carpet, rotted away. All the odds and ends — hoarded candy, worn slippers, favorite shirts, collars of long dead but much loved dogs — the accumulation of a lifetime is gone. \r\n\r\nMy brother and I returned to New Orleans on Dec. 4 for graveside and memorial services for my father. Daddy is buried at Hebrew Rest Cemetery. I don’t know how much of the rest of the congregation of Temple Sinai has returned. Many of my parents’ friends have bought houses elsewhere, forsaking New Orleans and the network of lifetime friendships. My mom, fifth-generation New Orleanian, wouldn’t think of giving up on the city. New Orleans shaped her as it did my dad. They represent a generation imbued with character, their memories reaching back to the stories told to them by great grandparents whose primary language was French or German. If New Orleans is to survive, if its history informs the future, it will be because of people like my parents. That’s why it was so important for them both — in death as in life — to return. \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n©2005 The Independent Weekly, LLC  All rights reserved\r\n \r\n');

Hirsch, President and Executive Officer of Touro Infirmary to the Acts of Heroism Project.\r\n\r\nLes became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Touro Infirmary on August 22, just one week before New Orleans took a almost knock out punch from Katrina, first from the hurricane and then, when we thought the worst was over, from flood waters caused by failing levees.  With almost no time to become acquainted with the hospital and its staff, Les took command, established a headquarters in the hospital for emergency staff and their families and pets to care for the 250 patients already in Touro.  In all, about 2,000 lives were in his hands. \r\nAl though the location in “the sliver by the river” saved Touro from high water, but the hospital’s generators failed, loosing power to air conditioning, elevators, internal and external communication, and eventually lack of running water and toilet facilities.  Les realized that evacuation was necessary and urgent. \r\nThe massive task would have been difficult for someone who had been here for years, with countless contacts. Imagine the ordeal for a CEO who had only a week in New Orleans under his belt. But Les Hirsch found a way. Using the Louisiana Hospital Association’s leadership as his only link, he got in touch with federal authorities, and Acadian Ambulance to evacuate the patients, beginning with the 13 infants in the Newborn ICU. Then the other patients were being evacuated when FEMA diverted the choppers elsewhere.  This delayed operations until Thursday morning, when, with just 79 patients left to evacuate, the Fire Superintendent ordered Les to leave the hospital within the hour, even if some patients had to be  abandoned. Les said there was no way that would happen. As the city became a war zone, Les engaged the aid of the Medical Staff President and the Chairman of Board, who pulled every string and called in every favor to arrange for air and ground transportation.  Surrounded by National Guard, firefighters, and a SWAT team, choppers, buses and vans arrived to empty the hospital. When the last patient had safely gone, then, and only then Les closed the doors and he and the staff, with family and pets, caravanned out of the devastated city. \r\nBut this is not the end of the story.  Less than a month after Katrina, Touro opened its emergency department, the first hospital in Orleans Parish to restore services. On October 12th, Touro resumed inpatient services, and that very day delivered the first baby born in an Orleans Parish hospital since Katrina. We are up and running, expanding services daily.  \r\nWhile we know there were many heroes at Touro, in fact, each and every member of the staff who stayed through Katrina is to be honored for courage and devotion to their profession, we know that it is the leader who sets the tone of behavior for everyone who follows.  The staff at Touro was inspired by Les Hirsch’s actions, and today, everyone who works with him expresses gratitude for his calm, but determined leadership.  Les Hirsch is a hero to  us at Touro Infirmary.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSubmitted by Catherine C. Kahn, Archivist\r\nTouro Infirmary.\r\n\r\n');

LOEWY\r\n\r\nLet me take you back to Torah times. We have just successfully escaped from Egypt under the leadership of Moses. We are still not sure about him, since his track record is mixed. He enabled us to leave, but we suffered and we have not reached the Promised Land yet. How is he going to keep us satisfied? Everyone is already complaining due to lack of food and water. Striking rocks to unlock hidden water supplies is a neat trick, but there is a long journey in front of us. \r\nThen along come the Amalekites. They attack. Not only that, they donâ€™t play fair, by approaching from the rear, where the weakest of our entourage are to be found. How dare they! The battle waxes and wanes, seemingly dependent upon how long we can see Moses with hands up or hands down. Clever those Jews, Aaron and Hur place stones under his arms, so they are always up. Joshua and his forces vanquish our foe, but not before significant losses.\r\nMoses is furious as is God, who is heard to say: â€œInscribe this in a document as a reminder, and read it aloud to Joshua: I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.â€ \r\nTime is a salve to feelings or is it? Forty years later, as Moses imparts his final wisdom to the people, following instructions on  appropriate weights and measures, all of a sudden a ghost from the past resurfaces: Zachor et asher asa lâ€™cha Amalek: Remember that horrible Amalek and what he didâ€¦ So when you are safe and comfortable in your new homes, â€œblot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!â€ Where did that come from?\r\nFast forward a little over 500 years. We, the Jews of Judea have been taken captive and transported to Shushan, the Capital City of Babylonia/Persia/Iran. Over time we have assimilated, becoming part of the community, though always a separate people. Some like Mordecai have risen to positions of prominence with access to royalty. He is even able to arrange for his cousin Hadassah to be considered for the Kingâ€™s harem. I know that may not sound all that wonderful to you, but in those days it was a big deal. She is even selected, which is quite a personal coup for him.\r\nThen along comes an ill wind, actually related by blood to the Amalekites of old, one Haman. Just when we thought we were safe, along comes this personal threat to our well being. We thought the King was a friend, a protector, when he turns out to be more or less, a buffoon. How could this be happening? We are furious!\r\nForced to rely upon our own resources, we are able to turn the tables on the would-be destroyer. Having Esther in a place of prominence opens the door. The gallows intended for us, become Hamanâ€™s ultimate end. To commemorate the victory , we read in the Book of Esther that Mordecai calls upon all future generations to remember the events, but in an odd way. From now on he says, every time we reach this time of year, we are going to party! What were days of sorrow, trial and tribulation will now be an occasion for feasting and gladness, sending gifts to one another and supporting the poor. \r\nTwo stories from our tradition on how our people faced impending devastation and ruin: This is Shabbat Zachor, the Shabbat prior to Purim, when we are taught to remember Amalek, while blotting out his name, just as we traditionally will blot out the name of Haman come Monday night. \r\nEach of us here tonight has a name that we would like to blot out, â€œKatrinaâ€. We feel similarly to Moses as he faced the Amalekites or Mordecai as he dealt with Haman. We are angry. When we say â€œKatrinaâ€ we are speaking about more than rain and wind, but we include the aftermath, what I will call â€œthe Achashveros effectâ€, the seeming ineptitude of our government to react properly. We thought we were safe, that pumps would push water away from our homes and that levees would hold. We are angry that insurance companies donâ€™t help us cope more easily, that most everything is a fight. We are angry that we have to deal with incompetent contractors, who say one thing, but do another. Little things perturb us. Iâ€™m peeved that my favorite service center down the street is probably not going to reopen, not to mention the great sadness we feel for all the personal and financial losses.\r\nWhat can we learn from our tradition on how to deal with these feelings? First of all, for this year only, I am planning to change one of our Purim traditions. Just as Estherâ€™s Hebrew name is Hadassah, did you know that Hamanâ€™s English name is now Katrina? I intend to substitute his name as I read the Megillah on Monday night, so that every time we would normally hear Haman, I will read Katrina. We will blot out the name with our groggers. It will be fun to simply let loose those feelings.\r\nIn the spirit of Purim, and Mardi Gras for that matter, we will blot out the name and celebrate. Feel free to come costumed in your blue tarps, your construction worker outfit, as a Hersheyâ€™s kiss or however else you want to thumb your nose at what has occurred. Comedy, sarcasm and parody are helpful tools for coping. \r\nFollowing this service we will have a gift for everyone, compliments of our friends Rabbi Jo David, Neil Yerman and her congregation. We have already received many gifts, let us start thinking about how we can give gifts to others, in particular those who are worse off than we are. \r\nSome suggest that part of the reason Moses was so angry about Amalek was that he had left those in the rear of the caravan vulnerable to attack. Many of us feel similarly guilty that we did not do enough for others before the storm and after. Congregationally we are in the process of implementing a plan to ensure that none of our congregants are left behind should there be future evacuations, as well as devising programs to help us cope.\r\nWhen we learn to blot out the name, while simultaneously never forgetting, our tradition is telling us that we do not have to be obsessed by the past, but neither can we forget it. With time we need to move on from the hurt inflicted upon us individually and as a community. Some are perhaps ready to do this already, others not. Ultimately, we must all do so. Not every response to a question has to have the Katrina reference: â€œhow are you doing?â€ can be answered â€œThe plumber did not show up, but the new chair arrived and we are still waiting for countertopsâ€ or â€œtoday had its highlights.â€ \r\nKatrina upset our world, but does not have to be the center of it. We have the power to decide how we will respond.\r\nOn this Shabbat Zachor we learn that we can blot out the name of Katrina and still not forget. It took Moses 40 years to come to that realization. Hopefully it will not take us that long.\r\n							AMEN\r\n\r\n');

Services resumed; religious school has begun; the office is open and our various activities have started. We are trying to return to normal.\r\n	Like you, the congregation is challenged financially. Some of our members will never return and many cannot afford dues or the contributions which they customarily gave. Our officers will make as many fiscal cutbacks as possible, but we do not want to diminish service to our members. Now more than ever, we want to be of help to you and your family.\r\n	Using e-mail or regular mail, you can help. Shortly after Katrina struck I sent a letter to my colleagues around America for donations to sustain our congregation. This was very awkward for me to make such a request, but necessary. Unsolicited, my brother in Connecticut and a family friend in Pennsylvania also contacted many of their friends and associates, not all being Jewish. As a result Gates of Prayer received thousands of dollars, including some from foundations, which have enabled us to assist our members. This was a wonderful start to ensure our future.\r\n	At the bottom of this letter is a sample letter that you might use to send to your friends and family across America. I know that this is unusual and perhaps presumptuous, but we are living through unprecedented events, requiring creative approaches.\r\n	Thank you for considering this request.\r\n\r\n							Lâ€™shalom,\r\n							Rabbi Bob Loewy\r\n\r\n\r\nSample letter\r\n\r\nDear ___,\r\n\r\n	Hurricane Katrina struck months ago, but our community is just beginning to recover, a process that will take years. An important part of that community is my synagogue, Congregation Gates of Prayer of Metairie, right outside of New Orleans.  Our \r\nbuilding sustained $1 million in damage - we lost pews, prayer books, school books, nursery school toys and all of our furniture.  Our floors and walls must be replaced and our once beautiful grounds restored.  Insurance will cover much but not all of our losses.\r\n\r\n	Our bigger challenge is the effect the hurricane had on our members. Some will never return. Many have lost their jobs and their homes or had their income diminished. Almost all have been adversely affected. As a result congregants will be unable to pay dues and support the synagogue the way they did before the storm.  We hope and expect the situation to be temporary, but in the meantime, my synagogue is fighting for its survival.\r\n\r\nAt this holiday season, I ask that you consider a tax deductible donation of any size to Congregation Gates of Prayer.  The address is 4000 W. Esplanade Ave., \r\nMetairie, LA. 70002. Or you can send it to the Union for Reform Judaism SOS New Orleans Fund 633 Third Ave. New York, NY 10017, but please mention that it is for Congregation Gates of Prayer.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for considering this important request about \r\ncontributing to my beloved congregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n');

Loewy\r\n\r\n	Like most of you, I am a bit disoriented this evening. I know it is Rosh Hashanah, but in truth my whole sense of time is confused. I have missed appointments, been unsure of what day and date it is. Time is measured in BK and AK: before and after Katrina. Throw in a diversion called Rita as well. And for our Beaumont friends who are here this evening, it was much more than a diversion. Nonetheless, here we are. Some internal yet eternal clock has compelled us to gather. Like migratory birds, our Jewish homing device prompts us to flock together. And it feels so good to see familiar faces to embrace one another. \r\nAs with you, this community is not my home. I actually have lived in Houston for seven years in the 70â€™s and 80â€™s, but for the past 22 years, New Orleans and Metairie have been my home, the place where my children have been born and raised, the community to whose rhythms I have swayed and whose flavors still linger on my palate, including familiar streets and stores and restaurants, sights and sounds. I can navigate directions by knowing lakeside and riverside, none of this north, south, east and west and loops. Left turn arrows might be efficient, but I miss my U-turns. A place where we know the difference between a canal and a bayou. Home- where the coffee is strong, the malls manageable, and the teams lose consistently, except for LSU. \r\nI am not complaining about Houston. This is a great city and the hearts of the people are as big as Texas. We all have been blessed with hospitality and caring from all Houstonians, many total strangers. And what of our friends and family who have graciously and unstintingly opened their homes to us performing acts of generosity without number. The Jewish community, with its various synagogues, schools, JCC, Federation, and Jewish Family Service, has all bent over backwards to make us feel welcome. I know that we are all deeply appreciative. The Jewish value of Hachnassat Orchim- showing hospitality to guests has been fulfilled magnificently, but it still is not home.\r\nAnd this is not my synagogue or yours. In fact it is not a synagogue at all. Yet our people learned long ago that one does not need a specific edifice to be a congregation. All that is required is a venue and a commitment, a shared agenda, a desire to reach out to God and for God to touch us. And so we are here tonight to recite the words, sing and hear the melodies, to be a united community. I believe that the prayers may speak to you like never before, as you open up your hearts and minds to their message.\r\nI have to confess that preparing this sermon was not easy. Iâ€™m a bit out of practice and out of sync. Undoubtedly you have found yourself similarly off kilter. Away from our familiar environments has us all floundering. Let me raise a few questions that might provide some balance to our lives. They are questions that are both specific to the unique circumstances under which we are living. Yet at the same time they are the fundamental questions of this holy day:\r\n1. Where are we? And what are we going to do with our days?\r\n2. What place will Katrina and Rita and its aftermath play in our lives?\r\n3. Where is God in all of this?\r\n	To each of these questions, let me apply three stories from our tradition. The first comes to us from Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel:\r\n	â€œThere once was a man who was very forgetful. When he woke up in the morning, he could never remember where he had put his things the night before. One night he worked out a plan. He took a pencil and a pad of paper, and as he got undressed, he wrote down exactly where he put his clothes. Then the next morning, when he woke up, he took the piece of paper and read the list. â€˜My cap is on the dresser.â€™ He went over to the dresser and sure enough, there it was. He put a checkmark on his list. Then he looked at the paper and it said, â€˜my pants are on the chair.â€™ And so he went to the chair and there they were. So, he put them on and placed another check on his list. He did the same for his shirt, which was on the table, his shoes and socks, which were under the bed, until he was fully dressed.\r\n	â€œEach time he put a little check mark on the list. And then he said, â€˜this is fine, but where am I?â€™ He looked and he looked, but he could not find himself.â€\r\n	I think we can all relate. We dress each morning and then wonder where we are, what we are going to do. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons we are here today, to find ourselves, our true selves. Rosh Hashanah is a time to focus on who we are and what is really important in our lives. The hurricanes have forced us to perform this act of soul searching prematurely. Like our ancestors before us, we were told to leave our homes with very short notice, not due to an oppressive edict, but as a matter of survival. And so we looked around our houses and quickly gathered or tried to protect our most precious items if we could: family pictures, heirlooms that linked the generations, essential papers, a few days of clothing, medications and then we were off to find safety. All the â€œthingsâ€ that we left behind were just that, â€œthingsâ€, perhaps beautiful, expensive, sentimental, but still just things, all replaceable to some extent.\r\n	So often we answer the questions of â€œwhere are we and what are we doing with our daysâ€ in terms of our jobs and what we have accumulated. Many are now struggling to redefine who they are, having been ripped from all that was familiar and established. Yet much has not changed. We remain husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends affirming those relationships through daily acts. We find ways to earn our livelihood and recreate homes. As we rebound from the initial shock of Katrina and Rita, we now remember who we are, with a clearer vision of what is truly important, as we go about filling our days with meaning. \r\n	A second story to deal with the question of the role these storms will play in our lives: Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach came to America from Austria as a refugee from Nazi Germany. He became a great mystic, story teller, song writer and performer. Carlebach traveled the world with concerts for Jewish and non-Jewish audiences, including trips to Germany and Austria. Somebody once asked him, â€œHow can you go back there? How can you give concerts there? Donâ€™t you hate them after what they did to you? Donâ€™t you hate them?â€\r\n	He responded: â€œIf I had two souls, I would devote one, full time, to hating them, but I donâ€™t. I only have one soul, and so I am not going to waste it on hating.â€\r\n	We have experienced on a much smaller scale, our own destruction turning us into refugees from our community. That term does not bother me, since we have in fact been forced to seek refuge. \r\nKatrina and Rita Have in many cases wiped out our homes, our businesses, our community, and our way of life. We have been robbed of our comfort zone. Some are angry with nature and what has happened, as if our anger will change anything. Others are rightfully frustrated with the initial response of the government to our plight and the situation of thousands, who are so much worse off than we are. The incompetence and seeming indifference are appalling. They rail against the President, FEMA, the Red Cross, the Mayor, the Governor, the politicians, all those who we seek to blame. There needs to be a thorough examination of what did and did not happen and why. Those responsible must be held accountable. \r\nBut like Rabbi Carlebach, we only have one soul and we can use it much more constructively and positively. Dwelling in our anger, seeking blame, holding grudges will not enable us to emerge from this more quickly. It will not change our reality. In fact it will distract us from our ultimate purpose of healing from this wound that has been inflicted upon us. It is a waste of energy and a beautiful soul. We can do better.\r\n	And the question that I am often asked: â€œWhere is God?â€ It is not unusual to raise questions about God, when faced with crisis and adversity. Of course, when everything is going just fine, we more often than not leave God out of the equation. Let me attempt to answer the question with a Biblical moment and a bit of Hebrew word play.\r\n	In the Book of First Kings we read of the prophet Elijah, who was forced to take refuge from those who wished to kill him. He was a spokesman, a prophet of God, a good man, but nonetheless compelled to flee.  He arrived at Mt. Sinai and entered a cave, where he spent the night.  God called to him to come out of the cave and stand on the mountain, and now I quote: â€œThe Lord passed by. There was a great and mighty wind, splitting mountains and shattering rocks by the power of the Lord, but God was not in the wind. After the wind, an earthquake, but God was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, a fire, but God was not in the fire. (and we might add after the fire, torrential rains and floods, but God was not in the waters.) And after the waters, a soft, murmuring sound, a still, small voice.â€\r\n	My friends, God is not in the hurricane. Katrina and Rita were not acts of God, but simply of nature, part of the forces in our world, which are simply random. God did not sit around and say, â€œlast year was Floridaâ€™s turn, I think this year it is finally time for New Orleans and Beaumont. After all they are overdue.â€ I just donâ€™t believe God works in that fashion. \r\n	God is that still small voice that spoke to us when we lost faith and courage. God is the presence that reminds us there will be tomorrow and we will have the strength to face it. God provides us with a path to share our fears and know that we are never alone.\r\n	Many of you are familiar with gematria, the Jewish mystical search for meaning by using the numerical value of Hebrew letters. Each Hebrew letter has a numeric equivalent: Aleph- one, bet-two and so on. Using this method we discover that the Hebrew word for love: Ahavah- alef, heh, vet, heh = 13. Next we find Godâ€™s four letter name of Yod, heh, vav, heh = 26. In other words, two loves = Godâ€™s presence. During this crisis that we all continue to endure, have we not felt the love of numerous individuals coming to us? Whether from family members or strangers, close friends or those who have contacted us after decades out of the blue, all these expressions of love are messages of Godâ€™s presence. Literally, millions of dollars have been donated to help us and we should not hesitate to be recipients.  \r\nI like to think of these people who are busily doing what they can for us as Godâ€™s angels, performing Godâ€™s work and we are the beneficiaries.\r\n	This Rosh Hashanah provides us with an opportunity to experience a bit of the familiar. May we come to realize where we are and ultimately what we are to do with our lives. Let us put the past weeks of pain into its proper perspective, as we connect with God. May the words of prayer speak to us and the presence of a caring, wounded congregation bring us together.\r\n							AMEN\r\n');

Loewy\r\n\r\n	It has been six weeks since we all fled our homes. Since then if you are like me, you have had a number of different addresses. I started in Houston with friends for the first few days, then on to Waco, Texas with my in-laws, when we realized this was not going to be a short evacuation; then we had an address in Baton Rouge, which we never really used, returned to the friends home in Houston, while they were on a cruise, and finally settled in an apartment in Houston. Wait, another hurricane coming, time to go back to Waco. I just love those bumper to bumper 5 hour drives to travel what is normally 1 hour. False alarm- back to the apartment in Houston. As of this week, I will be home, well at least the upstairs of my home in Metairie, while the downstairs is repaired and my family remains in Houston for the remainder of the Fall school term. Phew- This brings a whole new meaning to the term â€œwandering Jewâ€. I know I am not alone. Many of you have similar sagas.\r\n	This story of Jewish people wandering is of course not new to our history. Our early patriarchs and matriarchs traveled until they developed a relationship with the land of the covenant. Israel became our home and continues to be a home for the Jewish people unto this day. Historically from a Jewish perspective a map of the world places Israel at the center and everything else is considered â€œGalutâ€. This expression is quite interesting, since it is most often mis-translated as â€œdiasporaâ€, referring to the lands to which the Jews were dispersed. However, its real meaning is â€œexileâ€, the destinations to which we have been forced to live, with the most prominent example being when the first Temple was destroyed and the kingdom of Judah was placed in exile in Babylonia. When we are not home, we view ourselves as being in exile. The locales in which we find ourselves are not necessarily bad, but they are simply not home. I think we now have a sense of what that means. \r\nHad you told me years ago, that I might one day be sermonically equating New Orleans to Jerusalem, and every place else as galut, I probably would have told you, you were crazy. A link to Sodom and Gomorra, maybe, but Jerusalem???  But we are now living in very different circumstances, calling for radical understandings.\r\nLet me explain this comparison. Jerusalem and Israel was the land of our faith beginnings. It was where the Temple once stood, the Priests administered their rites and the Prophets spoke their words of truth. It was the covenantal home of the Jewish people. When the Babylonians conquered Israel, they destroyed the Temple, took the leadership and much of the community captive, transferring the population to Babylonia, ripping them away from all that was comfortable and familiar.\r\nWe were forced to adapt to a strange and foreign land. The good news is that we succeeded. Not only did we adjust, we began to thrive. We maintained ourselves as a distinct community and created new institutions, the synagogue and house of learning. We developed new models of leadership with the role of scribes and teachers, who ultimately became rabbis. So, my question for this evening is what will we be able to learn from our ancestorâ€™s historical experience and apply to our own? Though oppressive armies did not come in and carry us off to captivity, we too have fled from our homes by forces beyond our control and are compelled to live in exile, at least for the time being.\r\nThe first lesson is that we can do it. Though initially we all found ourselves in a state of shock, we have summoned the strength and creativity to fashion new lives for ourselves and our families. The homes may not be as spacious. Perhaps we are sharing rooms with family or friends. That too is nothing new in our history. Read the stories of life on the Lower East Side. Remember tales from the ghettoes. We may not have all the conveniences that were once ours, but we know that we are much better off than so many others. \r\nSome of us have been able to continue our occupations, simply transferring offices. Computers and cell phones make it easier, though if I have to say, â€œCan you hear me nowâ€ one more timeâ€¦. But what would we do without them? Others have had to be more resourceful, finding what work they can for the time being, while others are still in search.\r\nIt was actually in Babylonia that the Jewish self-help organizations had their origin. The soup kitchen, free loan, bridal and burial societies all began there. Now we have our Federation, Endowment and Family Service. We always knew that we were our brothersâ€™ and sistersâ€™ keepers, but these groups have been dynamic, pioneering ways to assist us, from finding housing and jobs, to cars, schools, doctors and so much more. I have no doubt that when we no longer find ourselves in positions of need, we will all be much more active to provide support to others. \r\nIn the meantime, we should not hesitate to seek help and be recipients of assistance. Your rabbis and the community have received thousands of dollars to help individuals in our congregations. Our challenge is finding those who could benefit. We are not mind readers. While we cannot rebuild your house, we have funds to help you fix your car, buy clothing or food, help pay a monthâ€™s rent or aid in a variety of ways. If you need assistance, please do not be shy. If you know of someone and would like to confidentially share that information, that too is appropriate. In Babylonia we learned the value of tsedakah, not only the necessity to give, but the mitzvah of receiving. Let us be open to that possibility. And those of you who are blessed to be in positions of financial strength, I know you will reach out to others and support individuals and institutions, so that they may continue. \r\nThe Psalmist wrote: â€œBy the waters of Babylon we laid down and wept for Zion.â€ Mourning for what is lost, shedding tears is certainly in order. I for one have often wept during this time of trial. I mourn for what has been destroyed. It starts with the thousand souls, who are now gone from our community. I am bothered by the fact that to my knowledge, I did not know one of them. That is a sad commentary on me, and the structure of our community, one that needs to be rectified. I weep for my dear ones, family and friends, who must endure these difficult times and whose lives are so disrupted. I mourn for the potential loss of a vibrant city and culture. Who knows what it will be like in the future? It is just too soon. \r\nI know that I am not alone in mourning. We all do. We mourn for our way of life that may now be different. We mourn for the friends, who are distant from us, some of whom may not return. We mourn for the objects lost. While we should not be materialistic, what has been destroyed is still important to us, a cherished painting, a favorite chair that fit just right, family albums from joyous times, furniture and other heirlooms that had been passed down through multiple generations, the homes where we raised our children, the businesses and offices where we spent our days. Some of these will be gone forever, others recoverable. Still we mourn.\r\nAt the same time, while living in galut, we always envisioned the future. â€œIf I forget thee O Jerusalem, may might right hand lose its cunning.â€ â€œNext year in Jerusalem.â€ These were the words that always reminded us that there was a home to which we could and should return. \r\nHere is where a problem arose. Babylonia ultimately turned out to be quite hospitable. So did Spain and many other lands to which our people have been dispersed, including America. We make ourselves at home and adapt to wherever we are. Jerusalem may be in our prayers, but now it is only the place we talk about and occasionally visit. That is another sermon.\r\nI will be honest, I fear for the future of our city. I donâ€™t want to see New Orleans become the city we nostalgically remember from afar. We have to admit. The shopping really is better in Houston: Neiman Marcus, Nordstrum and the Galleria, not to mention world class medical facilities. Baton Rouge is prettier, with a little roll to the land and magnificent trees and water, plus you can still find a bowl of gumbo if that is your craving. Atlanta offers so much: a large Jewish community with institutions to match, jobs, bountiful young people for our young adults and seemingly limitless opportunities. I can come up with similar attractive aspects of the other communities, where our people are scattered: Dallas, Memphis, even Jackson. \r\nBut none of them are New Orleans with its very unique culture: architecture, food and frivolity. New Orleans, where everything is relatively close and the traffic, now that we have experienced other communities, is not bad at all. Our city is unique from all others.\r\nAnd what of our Jewish community? For over 200 years, we have called New Orleans home. Touro Synagogueâ€™s origins go back to 1828 and Gates of Prayer has been in existence since 1850. We built our synagogues, created institutions- the JCC, Jewish Family Service, a community Day School, a home for our elderly, a Federation to coordinate it all. We organized our community with ADL, Hadassah, Bâ€™nai Brith, National Council of Jewish Women, NFTY, BBYO and other groups over time.\r\nI canâ€™t tell you that returning to Jerusalem and rebuilding was easy. It was not. Just read the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The land was in ruins. Civil structures were non-existent. So too, it will be a challenge in our beloved community. We will all have to sacrifice and be inconvenienced. Government will need to take a leading role to repair the infrastructure to protect us from future storms. The business community will have to creatively bring commerce back, more than just conventions and tourism. The social structure must be seriously addressed, as we commit to quality education for all and find ways to break down walls of separation between the races. The waters did not discriminate, neither should we. With leadership and commitment and lots of help, New Orleans can return to a position of prominence. It can thrive again, perhaps in new ways as never before. \r\nThis will include our Jewish community. We have all seen what mobilized Jewish structures can do in an emergency. Let us use the same energy for renewal.\r\nLiving in Galut is not so bad, but living in our home can be better. Bashanah Habaah bâ€™New Orleans. Next year may we all be back in New Orleans.\r\n							AMEN\r\n	\r\n\r\n	\r\n');

Loewy\r\nCongregation Gates of Prayer of Metairie, LA\r\n\r\nHow appropriate, this weekâ€™s Torah reading is Parashat Noah and here I am to discuss the New Orleans flood! As you know, I am here tonight, because it is our brilliant and talented nephew, Jake Potashnickâ€™s Bar Mitzvah weekend. We are very proud of him and his accomplishments and look forward to celebrating this day. Providing me with this opportunity is a true example of Gemillut Chasadim, an act of loving kindness. Not only can I apprise all who are present of the current situation in New Orleans, but this way my wife, Lynn, and daughters, Sara and Mica, and I are spared from having to repeat the story over and over and over again.  Lynn and Mica are living in Houston. Sara began her Freshman year at the University of Texas and I have been back in New Orleans since before Yom Kippur. This weekend is a very welcome break to be together and away from it all. Many families have had to temporarily split up. Life back in New Orleans is not easy.\r\nFor the past ten weeks, since Hurricane Katrina came ashore and wrought her destruction, those of us from New Orleans are fixated on the storm and its aftermath. Little else registers on our personal radar. It is all consuming and that will not change for quite some time.\r\nLet me tell you our story, as it is similar to that experienced by many others in the Jewish community. On Saturday morning, August 27, a storm that we thought was heading for the Florida panhandle started shifting direction in a threatening towards the Louisiana Gulf Coast. It was time for the Hurricane drill. We have been through this a number of times before, most recently evacuating for Hurricane Ivan right before Rosh Hashanah in 2004. \r\nAt home we collected our necessary papers, backed up the computers, disconnected electrical equipment, moved items to the second floor, placed family albums in a safe place, filled the cars with gas and continued to monitor the weather. At my synagogue, Gates of Prayer, a 155 year old congregation, we removed the Torahs from the ark, transporting them to an interior room in a high rise office building and covered them in plastic. Then we backed up computers, moved some of them off the ground, tied down playground equipment in our Nursery School and hoped that once again the storm would take another turn.\r\nUnfortunately it did not. By 7:30 that evening, the car was packed and we were on our way. Earlier in the day we thought our destination might be the URJ Henry S. Jacobs Camp, our regionâ€™s version of Olin Sang Ruby, but when we saw the projected path of the storm heading in that direction, we chose to go west. Hundreds however did use Jacobs as a refuge. Our goal was Houston. We escaped from the city driving west on what were normally the eastbound lanes of the interstate, but now were switched for evacuation purposes. By 3:00 AM we arrived at the home of dear friends, exhausted but not really able to sleep. Restful sleep following a hurricane is a rare commodity in general. It will take months to return.\r\nKatrina began to strike the Greater New Orleans area on the evening of August 28 and the early morning hours of Monday the 29th.   Due to a slight eastern shift at the last moment, the coastal towns of Mississippi bore the brunt, but the New Orleans area was severely battered.  \r\nThat Monday evening, I conducted a worship service in Houston for members of the New Orleans community who had fled there. Friends of ours refer to it as â€œThe Thanksgiving Serviceâ€. We were all feeling relief that the storm was not as devastating as we had initially feared. Next morning we learned of the breaches in the now infamous 17th Street and Industrial Canals. We also heard of flooding along the drainage canal, which sits alongside our synagogue and flowed into the homes of many congregants, including ours. \r\nWe realized we would not be returning home for a while. It was time to head to Waco, where Lynn and JoAnnâ€™s parents live, to regroup and be strengthened by family support. We needed to come up with a strategy. Returning home was out of the question for weeks. We considered an apartment in Baton Rouge, which is about an hour from New Orleans and Mica would attend school there. We even had an address.  Then Plan B- I would live in Baton Rouge, Mica and Lynn would live in Atlanta, in order to attend a Jewish Day School with friends. Plan C- Go back to Houston, where the largest number of our members had initially evacuated, so that I could minister unto them, use the offices of Congregation Emanu El, where I had been an assistant rabbi over 20 years earlier, and be prepared to travel. Plan C was chosen. We rented an apartment in Houston for three months, enrolled Mica in a Jewish High School, and I established a base of operations at my former office.\r\nMy first challenge was to find my congregation and determine how I could be of help. Computers and cell phones came in quite handy. My people were and still are scattered throughout the United States with most fleeing to Houston, Baton Rouge, Memphis and Atlanta and numerous other locales, with the more exotic being Park City Utah, Vail, Colorado and Southern California, even one family to Chicago. Of my 475 families as of this date, there are only about 30 families, with whom I have not had some contact. \r\nHigh Holy Days were coming. This required creativity and cooperation with my colleagues from the other Reform congregations. We had to shed our distinct congregational labels and serve each otherâ€™s congregants, not an easy task in any community. For Rosh Hashanah I conducted worship for New Orleans evacuees in Houston, while my colleague led worship in Baton Rouge in the evening and at his synagogue in New Orleans in the morning, since a trickle of people had begun to return. For Yom Kippur, we switched. It was ten days later and I had 500 congregants in Metairie, that morning. \r\nI believe that my congregation can serve as a microcosm of the New Orleans Jewish community, in terms of Katrinaâ€™s impact. Approximately 30% of my members had their homes destroyed to the extent that they are totally uninhabitable. They are living in rentals, staying with friends or family, while a few already have their new chic FEMA trailer. Another 30% or so have situations like ours, where there has been major destruction to part of the house. I am currently living on our second floor, while the downstairs is, shall we say, under renovation, right down to the studs. Another 20% had a little damage, while the rest were spared. \r\nAt this time about 50% of my members have returned to the Greater New Orleans area, probably a higher percentage than the other congregations, since mine is in the suburbs, not the city.\r\nOf the four Reform synagogues of Greater New Orleans, mine suffered the most damage. We are not the congregation that many have seen in the media, where Torahs had to be rescued. That is an Orthodox synagogue, physically destroyed for all intents and purposes. In fact they may soon start using our multi-purpose room for services. My congregation had water throughout the building, necessitating the removal of all flooring and walls up to four feet. We had to discard most furniture including the sanctuary seating. We are looking at about $1 million dollars in repairs, much of which will be covered by insurance but some will not. The other Reform congregations had damage, but not to the same extent.\r\nAll of us are very concerned for the future. Sad to say, we believe that 10-20% of our members will be leaving New Orleans permanently. Of the remaining 80% at least half will be dealing with major personal economic challenges. Jobs are gone. Businesses have been ruined and may not be able to return. Due to loss of income, they will not be able to support the Jewish institutions as before. Putting it bluntly, we canâ€™t expect people to pay dues when they have no money. Even the wealthy are not in the same position they once were. Our concern is finding the way to maintain our institutions during the time that it takes to rebuild and renew our lives.\r\nThis is where we look to the larger Jewish community. I will be honest to say that throughout this ordeal I have frequently been in tears. However, those tears are often precipitated by magnificent acts of generosity. My Rabbiâ€™s Discretionary Fund has swelled, enabling me to distribute thousands of dollars to members in need and we are all in need to some extent. We know that our Reform Movement stands behind us. The Union for Reform Judaism has had a major collection for Katrina Relief and I know this congregation has contributed. Half of the funds have been used for the general public, particularly establishing a relief center in Mississippi. The rest will help supplement our congregations, providing funding for the alternative High Holy Day services I described, repairs, cash flow, expert counselors to come in and meet with our members, all of whom are traumatized to some extent, and outside consultants to aide us as we plan for the future. In addition the UJC, the national organization of Federations, has funds to assist us. One of my new roles is a fundraiser, both for my synagogue and individuals.\r\n I have never been in a position where I needed to ask for assistance like this, nor have most of my members. Part of my task is to teach people that there is no shame in being needy. Sadly, they are learning. \r\nLife is not as comfortable for anyone as it once was. Businesses you once relied upon are no longer there. Stores and restaurants that are open have limited menus and supplies. Dust and debris are everywhere. In New Orleans itself, areas are still without electricity, water and services. Sections of the city are desolate. \r\nIn fairness, much of what I have described is how the â€œhavesâ€ of Greater New Orleans are impacted. As most of you know, we have a significant population of underprivileged and underserved, the â€œhave notsâ€ of our society. You have seen their faces, huddled in the Superdome, being rescued from rooftops, or their bodies floating in the waters. \r\nI fully realize that the inconvenience and despair that my congregants and I are feeling, pales in comparison to what these people have endured and will be facing. We can be hopeful that this may lead to a better life in their futures. The public schools of New Orleans, which have been abysmal, will now be Charter Schools with a mandate for improvement. Areas of squalor will be replaced with improved housing. The entire racial balance of the city is about to change. We will all be dependent upon the largesse of government, particularly for repairing and improving the levee system. \r\nAt the same time, New Orleans is starting to come back. Music is again playing on Bourbon Street. Cajun cuisine is served in some of our wonderful restaurants. Street cars are not yet rolling, but some businesses are re-opening. The Saints continue to lose. (at least you hope that will be the case this Sunday.) We are coming back to a new normal. \r\nNew Orleans will never be the same as it was before Katrina. But just as there was hope and a new covenant following Noahâ€™s flood, we have hope for the future. It is based upon an indomitable spirit and a commitment by government, community and religious leaders to move forward. We know that we are not alone as our Jewish community and the entire nation unite in our support.\r\n\r\n				Thank you and AMEN\r\n');

In truth, I am not even sure who is receiving this. I went through my AOL address book, which I had to return to as I evacuated. Do you have any idea how many of our colleagues use either Rabbi, Rav or Rebbe in their e-mail addresses? Nonetheless, I know that I am writing to friends and people who care.\r\n \r\n    As most of you know, I am now the rabbi for a congregation, Gates of Prayer, which has a new understanding of what it means to be dispersed. Katrina came and devastated our community. At least half of my 475 families have major damage to their homes and businesses, many totally destroyed. The synagogue was flooded just enough to require us to tear apart the sanctuary sitting area (pulpit is fine), pull carpet throughout the building, throw out any wood products that had contact with water (mold is growing), throw out most of the toys in our nursery school, strip the walls from 4 ft up down to their studs. We will not be able to reopen our schools until after Thanksgiving.\r\n \r\n    In addition, we will need to find a way to sustain a congregation and a budget for the next few years. We assume that we will lose between 10-20% of our members, who will simply not come back or can''t. The members we have will have great difficulty paying dues for a while. Yes, insurance will help a great deal, but it does not come close usually to keeping people even.\r\n \r\n    So, I have a new job as a rabbi. First, I will wander from community to community where my members now reside. I have already conducted services in Houston, where I am living, and Baton Rouge. I can imagine that I will possibly be traveling to Atlanta, Memphis and Jackson, where others now are. Plus, as some return to Jefferson Parish, which is possible, I will be back in Metairie. I am on the phone and e-mail constantly keeping contact, finding ways to help.\r\n \r\n    I am also in the fund raising business. I thank many of you, who have already sent donations to the Gates of Prayer Rabbi''s Discretionary Fund c/o Congregation Emanu El 1500 Sunset Blvd. Houston, TX 77005. This will enable me to provide immediate assistance to my congregants, who are experiencing a variety of challenges. It also funds my traveling. \r\n \r\n    My concern is for the long term. I would hate to see us have to release our educator, our soloist or administrator. I don''t know how we will pay teachers for our religious school and nursery school. Parents will be strapped to pay tuition. Even the basic needs of a building will be challenged. On top of everything we still have over a million dollars to pay on a mortgage. Yes, we will refinance and extend loans, get a line of credit, but those still need to be paid.\r\n \r\n    This is where I am turning to you, your congregations and your contacts. Many have asked how they can partner with us. My thought is simple. We need partners to consider supporting us for the next year or two. While buying siddurim is attractive, we will need sponsors for ongoing activity: our Religious School, Nursery School, Music Program, Continuing Education, Worship, Youth Activities, Administrative Staff, Rabbinic staff, Elder programs, Daily and long term fiscal responsibilities, Membership Development and every other aspect of synagogue life with which you are familiar. \r\n \r\n    I write this with a heavy heart. I am deeply concerned for the future of this congregation and Jewish community. Congregation Gates of Prayer is 155 years old. I do believe we will be back, but not without a great deal of help. Please think about my request, how you and your congregation, or perhaps some of your more philanthropic members might be able to respond.\r\n \r\n    I can be reached at this e-mail address or rabbi@gatesofprayer.org. Currently, I have an office at Congregation Emanu El 713 529-5771 X214, 713 859-9453 (C) 832 778-7459 (H). I may be away for the next day or two, since Hurricane Rita might come for a visit to Houston. I don''t plan to stay and be hospitable. \r\n \r\n    Thank you for your friendship and whatever you can do to be of help to us.\r\n \r\n                                                                                B''yedidut,\r\n                                                                                Bob Loewy\r\n \r\n');

Loewy\r\n\r\n	Mah tovu ohalecha- How Goodly are your Tents O Jacob, your dwelling places O Israel! I look out tonight and bear witness to the power of renewal. Since August 29 we have been immersed in Refuat Haguf, physical healing and Refuat Hanefesh- spiritual healing of our congregation.\r\n	After 3 feet of water turned our sanctuary into a well, and inches of water spread throughout the building, countless individuals have worked non-stop to bring us back physically, to restore our prayer space, revive our learning centers, re-activate our business systems. Those who have participated in tonightâ€™s service deserve particular attention, as I have mentioned earlier. I have maintained for years that as a rabbi, I have been blessed with outstanding lay leadership. In the face of an enormous crisis, Miriam Latter, her officers and board rose magnificently to the occasion. She entered office with her agenda of spirituality and caring, to have it replaced by search and rescue. I know that as we start looking to next year, spirituality and caring will take on a whole new dimension. \r\nSpecial mention must be made about the outpouring of support that has come to us from the entire Jewish community. The role of our organized Reform movement through the URJ has been nothing short of fantastic, providing us with both resources and expertise to navigate through the morass. Through Katrina Relief and the SOS Fund combined with our local Jewish Endowment Foundation, we have received hundreds of thousands of dollars to meet many of our expenses. In addition to that we received $125,000 from the American Jewish Committee to rebuild our sanctuary and thousands more from numerous synagogues and individuals from across America. Though no funds have yet been directly forthcoming from the Federation movement, we are anticipating that as well. All of this has enabled us to repair our building, assist our members and prepare for the future. It has been both humbling and gratifying. Refuat Haguf- the physical recovery and healing of our building is almost complete and we could not be more delighted.\r\n	Refuat Hanefesh, the healing of our spirit takes longer, but we are on our way. Looking out each week and seeing so many returnees lifts us as we rebuild our congregational family. Each new face at Shabbat services adds to our strength; watching the children as they walk into the building on Sunday; sitting down with our Zekenim our elders for lunch and friendship; realizing there are added members deliberating around our board tables; sharing with adults gathered in study; processing all those walking into the building to buy scrip and saying hello; meeting with Nursery School children on Friday mornings and Bâ€™nai Mitzvah students during the week culminating in their leading worship; These are the real signs of healing. The doors are open and it is invigorating to return to business as usual. \r\n	Perhaps it is not quite as usual.  We are cognizant of those of our friends and family who have not returned yet or may not return at all. For those who are here and have returned home, we are fully aware that home is not the same. Many if not most of you are not living in the same conditions as you were on August 27. Homes have been damaged and destroyed. Businesses and jobs have been ruined, disrupted and diminished. All of us continue to suffer financially, emotionally and spiritually and that will not change over night.\r\nKnow that your synagogue is here to help. Coming at the end of this month and throughout May, we will be offering four different support groups, one for those struggling with family issues- helping their children and grandchildren to cope and/or dealing with multiple generations under one roof; another group specifically for business people to provide professional business coaching; a third designed for those who feel as if they are too old to deal with all of this, but have to anyway; and a fourth for all those just feeling the stress, anxiety and worry of our Post Katrina life. All four groups will be led by qualified professionals. I hope you will take advantage of these opportunities. \r\nOn a more delicate subject, I and the entire congregational leadership are fully aware that many are suffering financially. Income has been lost, or even if it has not, all sorts of expenses have increased. I have received thousands of dollars, as well as gift cards for a variety of stores to share with my members. Please donâ€™t feel as though this is intended for someone else. Recognizing that one is in need and accepting assistance is a positive act of healing. \r\n	On this Shabbat we officially rededicate ourselves to the mission that this congregation has fulfilled for 156 years to be the spiritual home for our members, as always committed to reaching out to God, studying Torah and embracing Am Yisrael- the Jewish people. \r\n	As the prophet of old pronounced as he looked out over the Israelite encampment- Mah Tovu Ohalecha Yaakov: How goodly are your tents O Jacob, your dwelling place O Israel. So, may it be.\r\n						AMEN\r\n');

Loewy\r\n\r\n	\r\n	My friends, tell me if you have experienced any or all of the following symptoms: loss of appetite, an inability to concentrate on tasks, tears come to the eyes at odd times, forgetfulness, inability to fall asleep and once you do, you are restless and wake up early.  These patterns are often associated with those who are in mourning. If you are like me you have experienced one or more in recent days. In fact I first wrote these words at 2:10 in the morning, when I could not fall back asleep.\r\n	Mourning is the process that allows us to come to terms with a major personal loss in our lives. Jewish tradition recognized long ago that we need to experience loss in stages, by creating a series of timed rules and rituals aiding us during our period of adjustment. If we think about what we have all recently experienced, I believe you will be able to identify with the obvious parallels. \r\n	When Katrina was first on her way towards us, we were in denial. Had we not been through these false alarms before? But this time, as with all of the storms, we took her seriously, just in case. As she came closer, most of us got out of her way and then came the shock. She was real. We were stricken. Our lives as we knew them were forever changed. So much of what was familiar is now gone. How were we going to respond?\r\n	As with death, we needed an initial brief period of intense grief, a time akin to shiva, the seven day mourning period. During that first week, it was difficult to think beyond the next minute. We tried to gain a handle on what had happened, but it proved to be elusive. We could not grasp to what extent our lives were impacted. It was just too soon. It was a time of fear and tears. So much was unknown! Some of us resorted to dark humor. I would talk about what we might do upon our return home, then quip: â€œOh wait, we may not have a home.â€ \r\nWe were immersed in our grief and concern, glued to the television and radio for ongoing news, especially to local sources, like WWL on the radio or WDSU on television, depending upon reception. Nothing else happened in the world as far as we were concerned. I recall being at my in-laws home in Waco, watching the Today Show, which was fully devoted to Katrina, but then at 9:00 they switched to golf. Golf??? Did they not realize our world was turned upside down, that Katrina and her aftermath were the only issue worthy of coverage? If we were fortunate, we had others caring for us during this time, friends and families to whom we had fled. God bless those souls, including the many anonymous men and women at hotels, shelters, stores and restaurants, who understood we were hurting. Each of us likely has a story of some stranger who bought us a meal or supplies, even if we could afford it, whose kindness touched our souls. We all needed that time of shiva and if we were fortunate enough to experience it, we were ready for the next stage.\r\nFollowing the initial period of mourning comes sheloshim, thirty days inclusive of the initial seven. With sheloshim following a death, we begin to renew our lives in a basic fashion, avoiding entertainment, but returning to rudimentary activity: going back to work, food shopping, starting school and preparing meals. So too following Katrina, we experienced a sheloshim of sorts. \r\nWe came to appreciate the enormity of what was before us and began to make preliminary plans on how we would cope. For some this included finding workers to begin the process of cleaning up or doing some of it ourselves if we could even return to our homes, deciding where we might live for an extended period of time until we could return, enrolling our children in schools, reconnecting with friends and family, trying to go back to work in some form. \r\nLet me point out that not everyone experiences all of this in the same way or on similar time schedules. It will vary from individual to individual and the extent to which homes and lives have been devastated. There is a Jefferson and Orleans divide as well, since people in Orleans were so delayed before they could even enter the parish to see their situation with their own eyes.\r\nFor most of us we are now past sheloshim, but we are still in mourning. Some of those same characteristics of functioning continue to be real in our lives, such as problems with sleep, appetite and the ability to stay focused. This is consistent with our tradition. Following sheloshim we spend a year saying kaddish in certain cases, as we adjust to the new reality of our lives. \r\nAre we not doing the same today? Today is my first day back on this pulpit. It feels familiar, but somehow not the same. Perhaps it has to deal with the sanctuary aesthetics, you think? But it also has to do with me. My life, the future course of my life and that of my family may change dramatically. There is so much that is unknown. It is still too early. I know this is true for me and for you. It does not matter if you have emerged from this storm physically unscathed with houses whole and jobs secure. Every one of us is affected, some more dramatically than others.\r\nIn this hour dedicated to memory, let us mourn. Let us mourn for over a thousand men and women and children, who lost their lives. We may not know them personally, but we share our common humanity. As we always do at this time each year, let us mourn for our own loved ones who have died, whether in recent days or long ago. Their memories are never too far from our hearts, even in difficult times such as these. \r\nFor many the greatest pain of the storm is the loss of precious pictures, heirlooms, family keepsakes and mementoes, which linked us to those now gone. Perhaps we are glad they did not have to endure these difficult days. Perhaps we wish they were here to guide and comfort us. May their memories fill that need. \r\nLet us mourn for the lives we once enjoyed, but will never be the same again. At least they will not be as they once were. Without being overly materialistic, we can mourn for the items lost: the dining room table where we shared so many meals and moments, the cookbook, which had favorite recipes, the painting that we purchased on that fun trip,  the business that you built, the home, where so many memories were created.  The insurance company may assign a replacement cost, but it will not fully replace the value in our hearts. Let us mourn.\r\nWe have also been robbed of time. We mourn for the lost moments: the milestone birthday or anniversary that was overshadowed, the wedding and Bâ€™nai Mitzvah that were either moved or postponed, the homecoming dance that was cancelled, the education that has been curtailed, and the hours and days spent coping with events, when we really wish we could have been following our mundane routine. \r\n\r\nHowever, as with death, we are forced to accept what reality presents to us, whether we like it or not. We can utilize the patterns of our tradition to guide us through this newest valley of the shadow, knowing that we are not alone; knowing that next year at this time, we will come together again. Life will be better. Our homes will be repaired, including our synagogue homes. We will be on a path of renewal. \r\nWe will mourn our loved ones and remember that there continues to be quality of life even after loss. We will weave the tattered shreds of our lives into a renewed fabric of wholeness.\r\nAs we deal with our losses of all varieties, may God give us strength. May God give us peace.\r\n						AMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n');

For the full article and other features, go to www.jvibe.com. \r\nâ€œI am about to close my third month here on Year Course, and leave Beit Riklis in Jerusalem for an apartment in Bat Yam. I have three more school days, one more Zionism siyur, three finals, two papers to write, one song in Hebrew to translate, and one JVibe article to write until the weekend rolls around.The transition should be an interesting one. Coming from Beit Riklis, our Year Course has been characterized by classes, dorm life, our proximity to Aroma coffeehouse and Hebrew U, and living with our madrichim (counselors). \r\nIn Bat Yam, Year Course will magically take a new form. My group, Paz, will join with Shachar, who has spent the last three months on "Israel Experience" where they have either completed Marva (an army program), a Navy boarding school, MADA, or worked at a youth aliyah village. We will live four to eight of us in an apartment, go to volunteer placements during the day, ulpan twice a week, and be left with the chance to not only live on our own, but to live on our own in Israel. Finally I can start doing something that helps out our country! While my Israeli counterparts are starting out their army service and American ones begin work on their bachelor degrees, you can find me in Bat Yam, tutoring in English and working at a community center.\r\nBut if I forget thee, O Jerusalem... A few times these past few months, I''ve walked out to the balcony of the Hecht Synagogue at Hebrew U in the late afternoon, to watch the sun set over Jerusalem. It is an image I will always see in my mind when I think of this city. Jerusalem is the center of the world! The entire city and the entire world itself seems to branch out from the gold Dome of the Rock and the Old City walls. If I look to the west, past the crowded downtown streets and the big hotels, past the horizon and the ocean farther and farther is the United States and my friends in universities and family in New Orleans. If I look behind me, past the university''s buildings to the north, past the houses on French Hill, and the Judean Hills stretching as far as I can see there is Lebanon and the cities of Europe and Russia. Looking out to the east, past the Arab towns and mosques is the vast desert-like lands of the West Bank, the Jordan River, Iraq and Afghanistan, India, China, and Japan. To the south, I can see Israeli communities, one next to the other, one after another, circling the hills; their orange streetlights and white car lights turning on one by one.

I bring this up, since this weekâ€™s Torah portion contains a discussion of the Biblical holy days.\r\n	The starting point is of course our weekly Sabbath. This revolutionary introduction to the world by the Jewish people can be as significant in our day as when it was created. We all need a Shabbat, a day of rest, a break from the stress and strain of our week, whether we be working in an office or at home, outdoors or traveling. While I would love to see all observing Shabbat through worship in the synagogue, I can be satisfied knowing that you are using the time for home and family.\r\n	The year is also punctuated with moments to connect with history and that which is transcendent. The High Holy Days remind us to be cognizant of creation and how we conduct our lives. The three pilgrimage festivals of Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot, times when our ancestors visited Jerusalem, now call upon us to appreciate Godâ€™s role in our lives and the blessings we enjoy. \r\n	Perhaps the intention of all of these Jewish times is to move us from the idolatry of self to an appreciation of others and that which is greater than us. That in itself is worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\n								Shabbat Shalom,\r\n								Rabbi Loewy\r\n');

Of course at the time I had no idea how significant it was. Only with the perspective of the years do I now appreciate it.\r\n	This is the section of the Torah that begins the Jewish people. We meet Abram for the first time, as he begins a relationship with the One God. He ventures forth from his home to what will be our Promised Land. Then he enters into a covenant with God. In every generation we renew that covenant, not only through life cycle ceremonies, but by an ongoing commitment to the teachings of our tradition. \r\n	Later this week, I, along with a number of Gates of Prayer members, will affirm our bonds as a Jewish people with 3,000 Reform Jewish leaders at our Biennial Convention in Houston.

Our teaching stresses both the obligation to assist those in need, but it also presumes that when one is needy, one should be open to receiving.\r\n	When our people were farmers, some years were lean, while others were bountiful. One farmer might do well and another badly. The corners of the fields were to be left for those in need.\r\n	Right now, many of us are in need. Cash flow has been interrupted. Business is not good.

We have come a long way since then.\r\n	And so this past week, we observed another New Year- Tu Bâ€™Shevat, the 15th Day of the month of Shevat, which according to the Talmud is the New Year of trees. What this refers to is the fact that one does not begin harvesting fruit until a tree is three years old. So, you ask, â€œwhen is a treeâ€™s birthday?â€ What the rabbis created was a system, which said that once a tree begins to bear fruit, the 15th of Shevat marks its birthday. After the third birthday, harvest away.\r\n	I propose that we adopt Tu Bâ€™Shevat this year to be a New Year for the congregation. The first part of the year, we just were not ourselves. We still are not completely remodeled and cleansed, but we are certainly up and running with all sorts of activity as you will see on this page.\r\n	In particular I point out this Friday night: Welcome Back GOP.

To be honest this is not my favorite Torah book. I have never been a great fan of the sacrifices as uplifting spiritual material. The dietary laws are challenging for the times in which we live and do not seem all that relevant. Of course the favorite section of Leviticus involves various kinds of leprosy and the rules related to coming clean.\r\n	Perhaps as a reward for spending a few weeks studying that material, we come to the Holiness Code: basic teachings on how to lead a holy life, with none being more popular than- â€œYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.â€\r\n	But we cannot just skip over the beginning chapters, as much as we might like to do so. The basic sacrificial offerings can speak to our contemporary situation. In essence they called upon our ancestors to turn to God on a regular basis, to keep the lines of communication open. When we sin, we must ask forgiveness through word and deed. The same is true even when just feeling guilty. Then come the offerings when thankful, whether it be for the general blessings we receive, or specific times when vows have been fulfilled. \r\n	Our ancestors may not have been so different from us after all. We may not bring burnt offerings, doves and rams to express our feelings to God, but we can bring our words, our thoughts and actions to be in consonance with the One who links us all. God is waiting to hear from us.\r\n\r\n								Lâ€™shalom,\r\n								Rabbi Loewy\r\n');

If he saw something he wanted, he required it instantly. He saw the opportunity for a birthright and he snatched it from his brother Esau. His mother told him how to steal a final blessing from his father, he quickly acquiesced to her plan. Upon seeing Rachel, he instantly knew that she was the one for him. Following each of these aspects in the Jacob saga, he came to realize that perhaps he should not have acted so quickly.\r\n	In this weekâ€™s Torah reading we meet the mature Jacob. He has been seasoned by time and learned one of the great virtues of living: patience. It was with patience that he was able to make the decision to return to his homeland. With patience he was able to reunite with his brother after years of separation. And it was with patience that he was truly able to understand and appreciate his relationship with God, as Jacob became Israel.\r\n	We, who are the children of Israel, can learn from our patriarch. If there is one virtue we all need at this time, it is indeed patience. In Hebrew, the term is â€œsavlanutâ€. It is only with patience that we can manage the enormous number of details necessary in rebuilding our lives. By adopting a patient attitude does not mean we should not try and make things happen, just that we can be prepared when all proceeds slowly. Our impatience does not generally result in events moving faster.\r\n	Let us be patient with one another and with all we need to accomplish daily. Remember that we are here to help you if we can:\r\n\r\n*  College Shabbat- December 23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n');

Many of us remember an â€œoldie but goodieâ€ entitled â€˜Mother-in-lawâ€, written by New Orleansâ€™ own Allan Toussaint. Starting with the words, â€œThe worst person I knowâ€, it goes downhill from there.\r\n	We can contrast that with this weekâ€™s Torah portion, one of the most significant in all of the Torah with the inclusion of the Ten Commandments. It is named after an in-law, Jethro (Yitro in Hebrew) Mosesâ€™ father-in-law. \r\n	Moses has just successfully led the Israelites out of slavery and brought them to Mt. Sinai. He reunites with his wife, children and in-laws. When Jethro sees how overworked Moses is, he implores him to appoint, Zekenim, elders of the community, to assist him in leadership. It was his father-in-law who gave him wise counsel and support when he needed it.\r\n	As we reflect upon the events of the last few months, all of us have been strengthened by our families, those to whom we are directly related and those to whom we are linked through marriage. In our case, it was to my in-laws that we initially evacuated and it was my nephew-in-law who came back with me for the first time. \r\n	So many different family members have provided us with love, caring and support during recent days. Let us pause and be grateful, perhaps expressing our appreciation now that life has calmed down, at least a little.\r\n	Family comes in many forms. It is time for in-laws to receive their proper respect. Moses knew it, as did the rabbis who named this weekâ€™s Torah portion.

Loewy\r\n\r\n	In New Orleans, we say: â€œWhere yâ€™at?â€ Others ask: â€œHow are you?â€ On one of my favorite television shows, Joeyâ€™s line is: â€œHow you doing?â€ In one form or another it is the question that all of us are asked by friends and family, or we are asking of ourselves. It has been almost seven months since, what Chris Rose has labeled, â€œThe Thingâ€, or what some simply refer to as â€œThe Stormâ€, while others use the name, â€œKatrinaâ€ descended upon us. \r\nThis Shabbat we read  Vayakhel/Pekude, the last portion in the Book of Exodus. It includes a review of the events in the life of Moses and the Israelites. With the portion as backdrop, we too can avail ourselves of the opportunity to take stock of where we are in our journey on the road to recovery, something we need to do periodically.\r\nIn case you had not noticed, rabbis donâ€™t think like normal people. We are always on the lookout for parallels between life and text, seeking Godâ€™s hidden messages for us to manage our daily affairs in meaningful ways. Reflecting on the Book of Exodus I find a number of parallels to what we have all endured in the past few months.\r\nSo there we were at the beginning of the book, dwelling in Egypt, minding our own business, not bothering anyone. We were happy, content, perhaps a bit self-absorbed. Then along came an oppressor, who would steal our tranquility, rob us of our sense of security, and turn our lives upside down. On Purim, I equated Haman to Katrina. Tonight, Pharoahâ€™s name is Katrina. She rose up to oppress us and we needed to escape.\r\nMost of us departed and made the waters part to find the dry land in Houston, Memphis, Baton Rouge, Atlanta and various other points on the globe. Initially we felt safe and secure. I recall leading a service in Houston on the Monday night after the storm, before we knew about levee failure and canal overflow. At that time, like the Israelites reciting the Song of the Sea, having reached dry land, we thought we had dodged the bullet once again. And we were spared to some extent, but there was more hardship to come. \r\nThen we began our wandering. For some it was from city to city, or from hotel to apartment, or from temporary shelter to a house. Our eyes would glance back in disbelief to what had been our home town. We were and still are incredulous over the extent of destruction and suffering.\r\nAnd so, like the Israelites, we were forced to temporarily reorganize ourselves. In the Torah this is the period of formulating laws for guidance. For us it involved creating contacts, finding schools, re-establishing work habits, reaching out to others, and fashioning homes. All the while, we gazed towards the Promised Land, hoping to return to our real home in safety and security.\r\nIn the meantime, God instructs us to build a Tabernacle, a temporary abode for our wilderness travel, a place where we can connect to what is really important. That is where we find ourselves tonight in Torah and for most of us in our lives. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the concluding portion in the Book of Exodus it includes a review and description of the building of the tabernacle and an accounting by Moses on exactly how all the donations were applied. Review, accountability and reflection are the elements that speak to us tonight.\r\nâ€œVayakhel Moshe: And Moses gathered all the congregation of the Children of Israel and said to them: These are the words which the Lord has commanded, that you shall do them.â€\r\nTwo different commentators look at this text calling for gathering the people and offer us related perspectives. The first (Or Penei Moshe) writes, â€œAs is known, the Second Temple was destroyed because of senseless hatred. Division and disputes always serve to undermine foundations of the social order. Therefore, before erecting the Sanctuary, Moses gathered all the people of Israel. \r\nThe completion of the Sanctuary/Tabernacle depends upon the unity of the people.â€\r\nPrior to Katrina our community was also filled with sinat chinam, senseless hatred, regional parochialism, bickering, racism, cronyism and more. It all contributed to poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, violence and crime. We can revert to our former ways and if we do, we will surely fall. Katrina literally changed the landscape of our community, providing us with an opportunity to make a difference, to rebuild and improve, to get involved, but we must be unified in that vision first.\r\nAnother commentator adds (Mi-ginzeinu Ha-atik) â€œWhen it comes to gathering together people, there is no problem: there are countless committees and conferences, meetings and sessions, morning, noon and night. They speak and debate, argue and discuss, without end. That was why Moses commanded: â€˜that you should do them.â€™- the purpose of all your meetings must be action.â€\r\nMeetings and committees are a rabbinic occupational hazard. I know that I am not the only one to suffer from this malady. However, of late I have participated in two committees of our congregation, both dedicated to making the lives of our members in Post Katrina time better. The energy, level of participation and involvement in those meetings were extraordinary. Most significantly, arising from the gathering will be a series of actions. That is what our commentator had in mind.\r\nCertainly throughout New Orleans there have been a plethora of talking heads and meetings. The Bring Back New Orleans Commission worked hard to present a report and strategy to rebuild our city and I say â€œour cityâ€, because regardless of where we live, \r\nthe City of New Orleans is the engine that drives our communal life. We need to support the efforts that will initiate well thought out action plans into place as soon as possible. People have their lives on hold and are dependent upon clear understandings of the future. Yes, there will need to be necessary sacrifices and areas that do not rebuild. Those of us, who are white and affluent, tend to be more accepting of this than those who are black and poor, according to a recent poll. We need to be sensitive to this. \r\nWith city elections on the horizon, we need to hold the candidates accountable and demand specifics on what they will and will not do, recognizing that they are not autonomous. Nonetheless, we need people who will act, not simply deliberate and support those who we feel will do the best job, whether we live in Orleans or not. \r\nNow is a time to gather the people for rebuilding. But our portion provides us with an additional thought. Immediately after calling for the gathering, we receive a caveat, a reminder that we must have our personal priorities in order. â€œSix days will work be done, but the seventh day is Shabbat.â€ Yes, we need to rebuild and plan for the future, but not 24/7. We need to be good to ourselves, take breaks, find pockets of pleasure and release. \r\nShabbat is holy time that we set apart for rest. I suggest that we create holy time, when we say or do nothing about or even peripherally related to Katrina. We canâ€™t ignore her and her aftereffects, but neither do we have to allow her to dominate every aspect of our being. Go to a movie; enjoy a meal; watch sports; exercise; listen to music; take a weekend away; read a book; escape. She will still be there when you return to confront her reality. \r\nVictor Frankel was a famous psychologist, who survived the concentration camps. Among his great teachings was that the Nazis could take everything away from him, except his capacity to choose how to respond. Katrina and her aftermath destroyed property and life as we knew it, but it is ultimately up to us to determine how we will react and cope. She can disrupt us, but she does not have to transform us, force us away from the lives and community we hold dear. \r\nAs we gather on this Shabbat, celebrating the first Bar or Bat Mitzvah in almost seven months, we look back and take stock. We have traveled a long way in that time and endured a great deal of turmoil and suffering. But we also have been blessed with bountiful gifts and support from family, friends and countless anonymous individuals, who touched our lives. \r\nWe have discovered internal resources that we never knew we possessed. Like our ancestors we hold onto a vision of wholeness as we seek to personally rebuild and return to our Promised Land. May God give us strength as we continue the journey!\r\n								AMEN\r\n\r\n');

Loewy\r\n\r\n	Hine Mah Tov- How good it is to be together, as we celebrate that we are up and running once again, that over 70% of our members have returned to our community, that in spite of everything we can perceive a hopeful vision for the future, tempered by a healthy dose of skepticism. \r\n	We could not be together for Rosh Hashanah, so we chose this evening to mark our new year. I would love to tell you that I very purposefully gave this date a great deal of thought, when in fact it was when Miriam and I would both be in town. Sometimes, you are just lucky, since fortuitously this past week just happened to be another Jewish New Year, Tu Bâ€™Shevat, the new year of the trees. We can â€œbranch outâ€ on that theme as we have replanted ourselves back home and commenced the process of growing once more. Just as it would have been in the Fall, we are only now beginning many of our programs. As in your lives, we had a two month gap in our synagogue life. So let us use Tu Bâ€™Shevat this year to mark our New Year. Let me wish you all a Lâ€™shanah Tovah.\r\n	Words from this weekâ€™s Torah portion also speak to us tonight. They are familiar, usually accompanying four cups of wine at a Passover seder. God speaks to Moses: â€œI have now heard the moaning of the Israelitesâ€¦. Say therefore to them, â€˜I am the Lord. I will free you from the burdens of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and through extraordinary chastisements. I will take you to be my people and I will be your God. I will bring you into the land.â€™ But when Moses told this to the Israelites, they would not listen, their spirits crushed by cruel bondage.â€\r\n	I would like to apply this text to our current situation and hope that our spirits are not so crushed that we cannot hear the message hidden within the exhortation. \r\n	Indeed, like our ancestors, we have rightfully been moaning. We were displaced; possessions, jobs, familiarity, lives have all been lost. Friends and family have deserted us. Yes, we understand their reasons, but it still feels like desertion. Many are not even sleeping in their own beds, at least not the ones from before August 29. Our community, as we once knew it is in shambles and prospects for the future are unclear. God hears our moans, understands them, embraces us as we confront an uncertain tomorrow.\r\n	â€œI will free you from the burdens of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage.â€ You know God, right now weâ€™d settle for the construction folks to show up when they say they will, for some good jobs other than McDonalds, and for a few more items to appear on a menu and while you are at it, how about a few less cars on Veterans, West Esplanade and I-10.  In truth we are experiencing incremental progress. Many of the inconveniences and hardships we endured two months ago like regular flat tires, no mail service, no movie theaters, are behind us, which provides us with hope for two months from now. More of us have returned to our own homes, found new or temporary residences or are the proud possessors of one of those sheik 30 ft. trailers.\r\nEven governmental actions are inching in more positive directions. We certainly could have done without the Mayorâ€™s comments. Personally, chocolate gives me a headache. I think the Mayor has a major one these days. Nonetheless, we now hear of moves to consolidate levee boards, commitment of federal dollars for levee repair and strengthening, the building of floodgates and more, cognizant that these are just beginning steps. Federal funds are on the way, the questions are how much and in what form? Controversial and hotly debated, there is at least a plan for the future of the city being put forth by a blue ribbon committee. People recognize that difficult decisions will have to be made and are rallying the public to stand behind them.\r\nâ€œI will redeem you with an outstretched arm and through extraordinary chastisements.â€ Let us reflect for a moment upon the many arms that have been extraordinarily extended to us. We start with those people and institutions that literally took us in as we fled. Next we recall those who have helped us return and resume our lives. Appropriately, my focus has been this congregation and its members. We have been blessed by almost three hundred thousand dollars that have been sent to us to aid our members, as well as our programs and rebuilding. That does not even include major support from our organized Reform movement and Federation. We need it all and will use it wisely. I appreciate those of you who have solicited outside of our community with friends and family on our behalf and encourage all of you to do the same. With that funding I have been able to be a conduit of caring, giving gift cards and checks to our members to restock their homes and rebuild their lives. It has allowed us to offer a variety of programs and activities to recreate a comfortable atmosphere. Many of our own members, who were not overly adversely effected have quickly provided appropriate support for the congregation as well. Clearly this synagogue is a priority in the lives of our members and it is heartening to see.\r\nHowever, redemption is not yet complete. Heck (thatâ€™s a presidential term in case you did not know it), Heck, this sanctuary isnâ€™t even complete. Redemption is not complete until repairs to our synagogue, our homes, our businesses, our schools, and our entire community have been fulfilled. Miracles may happen, but long ago we learned not to wait for miracles, that most miracles usually have human finger and footprints all over them. In the coming months each of us will need to find ways to make a difference. We are establishing a congregational committee, headed by Marc Beerman, to do just that. \r\nFinally we read, â€œI will take you to be my people and I will be your God. I will bring you into the land.â€ We are Godâ€™s people and tonight we are in Godâ€™s house, surrounded by friends and family. The path to be here has been difficult. Numerous individuals have worked endless hours to pull our programs, activities and building together and the journey to redemption is not complete. Nonetheless, we gather in support of one another. This synagogue, its leaders and professionals labor to do our share in partnership with each of you. We are committed to a brighter future for us all. Welcome back and welcome home.\r\n							AMEN\r\n');

We stand before you in humility, gratitude and hope. Since 1984, I have served as a rabbi in Greater New Orleans, a proud, vibrant, historic Jewish community.\r\nNever in our wildest imagination could we conceive of the situation in which we find ourselves today. We are not naÃ¯ve, living in the hurricane prone Gulf South, but the degree of personal and economic suffering is beyond comprehension. Pictures only provide a glimpse of the reality. Approximately 30% or more of our congregantsâ€™ homes are currently uninhabitable. Another 30% sustained major damage. Our people are displaced, professionals and businesses ponder how they can make a living, between the destruction and major population shift. \r\nSynagogue leaders explore ways to maintain congregations in the short term, when 20% of members will likely not return at all and the balance of membership will be financially compromised to support the institution as they once did. The challenges are mind boggling and overwhelming. As you might imagine, many tears have been shed.\r\nHowever, many of those tears are from gratitude. We are so thankful to the congregations of Houston, Baton Rouge, Memphis, Jackson,MS, Atlanta, Dallas and so many other communities that opened doors and hearts to embrace our members as we fled.\r\nWe are grateful to our Union, the movement in which I like many of you, have been raised from childhood, whose camps and youth programs nurtured me, whose seminary trained me, and now at the greatest communal crisis one can imagine sustains me and my community: Facilitating High Holy Day services in remote locations; supplying initial financial support both to individually aide our members and congregations facing an uncertain future and providing expertise and resources to prepare for tomorrow.\r\nAnd our tears flow in appreciation for the millions of dollars already contributed in keeping with the highest values of Judaism. We know that we are not alone. \r\nIn the midst of the devastation and destruction, we have hope for the future of Greater New Orleans. With your support, we will rebuild our synagogues and our lives. In 1983 the Union Biennial convened in this same city of Houston. By chance, I was a young Associate Rabbi here at the time. Six years later New Orleans was the host city. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future to a revitalized, re-Jew-venated New Orleans.\r\nThank you\r\n');

Loewy\r\nCongregation Gates of Prayer â€“ Metairie, LA\r\nFor Steven S. Wise Congregation\r\n\r\n	It has now been months since Katrina wrought her destruction upon our community and our lives. The wound is still fresh, as we rebuild our homes, synagogue and our community, renewing our spirits. I would like to examine our experience through the prism of our Jewish values.\r\nPikuach Nefesh: The preservation of life takes priority over all else. \r\n	I have been a rabbi in Greater New Orleans since 1984. We have evacuated five times under the threat of a hurricane, but this is the first time one really hit. When a storm is in the Gulf, we carefully monitor the situation and then are forced to decide between staying home, preserving and protecting property, avoiding the inconvenience of a false alarm, or being cautious and fleeing. Thank God, most of our Jewish community had the ability and chose the latter. The thousands, depicted at the Superdome and rescued from rooftops did not. \r\nHachnassat Orchim: Hospitality to guests\r\n	We fled in all directions, primarily to Baton Rouge, Houston, Jackson, MS, Memphis, Atlanta and Birmingham, and numerous points on the globe, including Australia. Wherever we landed, we were welcomed with open arms into homes by friends, family and complete strangers. Once the dimensions of the disaster became known, plans quickly changed. We had no homes. For many that would be temporary, but for some that reality would be permanent. Our hosts literally provided clothing, since some left with only one or two days of provisions, found us lodging and in good Jewish tradition, ensured we were well fed.\r\nKâ€™lal Yisrael- We are all part of one large Jewish community.\r\n	Often we think of our Jewish community as deeply divided, but during this crisis we united. All the rabbis of New Orleans came together to ensure that in the cities where the majority of our congregants had scattered, they would be served by a New Orleans rabbi. The synagogues, day schools, JCCs of America opened their doors. The alphabet soup of American Jewish life (URJ, UJC, AJC, ADL, US, NFTY, OU through XYZ) jumped to action raising funds, advocating for the displaced, providing us with a communal hug.\r\nTsedakah- performing righteous, charitable acts\r\n	Tsedakah has two components, one prominent, the other not as much. We learn from childhood to give to those in need. Millions of dollars have been donated to assist the victims of Katrina. I have been blessed with an outpouring of generosity: dollars for the synagogue and my discretionary fund, tangible items to assist us. I cannot begin to tell you how appreciative and humbled I am as a result.\r\n	However, the reality is that we need it. This is the second aspect of tsedakah that is not usually emphasized, the obligation to be open to receiving, when one suffers. There is not a person within a fifty mile radius of our synagogue who has not suffered. Who could imagine that comfortable middle class Jewish families could overnight need to be the recipients of food stamps, donated clothing, Red Cross and FEMA dollars, military ration packets, unemployment insurance and the individual generosity of millions? My role as a rabbi has become to teach our people to welcome these avenues of assistance and to be a conduit of caring. The rabbis teach that tsedakah is a wheel. We should always be giving, but one never knows when it will turn, so that you will be in need. The good news is it keeps turning.\r\nTikvah- We are a people of hope.\r\n	At this time I estimate that 75% of our members have returned to the area, though not necessarily to their original homes. Most are living in, rented facilities, FEMA trailers, second floors of homes where first floors flooded or with friends and family. Others will return at the end of the academic year, but perhaps as many as 20% will never return. Synagogues and other Jewish institutions will need to adjust to this diminished population, as well as the reality that at least temporarily those who are here will not be able to afford dues or other forms of support. This is where communal assistance will be critical.\r\n	But most are back. We are repairing our synagogue and homes. With frustration we are dealing with insurance companies and FEMA in order to find coverage, knowing that even under the best of circumstances, we will only receive compensation for part of what we have lost. In some areas we still do not know if we can rebuild or not. Personal livelihoods are challenged as men and women cope with the new business climate.\r\n	Still, we look to the future with hope. Yes, we know that we live in a potentially dangerous region. But hurricanes can wreak havoc up and down the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Then again, Californians live with the knowledge of earthquakes, Oklahomans with tornadoes. Who among us does not have the potential for some disaster in our lives? New Orleans is our home and has been for generations for this Jewish community. Gates of Prayer has weathered the Civil War and numerous storms throughout our 156 year history. \r\n	With spirits strong and the knowledge that we have the support of the Jewish community we have hope for the future.\r\n							\r\n	\r\n');

It''s not like\r\nthey can spend a week here and then return to the Coast -- there is nothing to return to:\r\nno house, no job, no car, no schools, no nothing.

The aim of this mission was for twenty-three Jewish high school teenagers, each accompanied by one parent, to visit Baton Rouge and New Orleans after the devastation caused by hurricane Katrina. It was especially profound for me to be part of such an important experience with my daughter, who, while we were in Baton Rouge, turned 16. I was deeply moved by her desire to celebrate this milestone by giving back to others who need so much  Over the course of the next three days, from April 9th through April 11th, our lives would be forever changed.\r\n\r\nOur agenda included performing community service, meeting with local Jewish teens and their families, other citizens of New Orleans, Katrina victims who had been relocated to FEMA trailers, and viewing the devastation in areas around New Orleans. The teens would be working in a soup kitchen and a food pantry.  They were given blank journals and asked to document their reactions to this mission by writing about what they felt, heard, smelled and witnessed. As a quilt artist, I knew that the best way for me to journal the experiences ahead would be to create a remembrance quilt upon my return.  I packed my camera and notebook into a knapsack, hoping I would be able to capture memories and impressions that could be translated using fabrics, threads, photographs and text in an art quilt.\r\n\r\nWe left on a cool Sunday morning before day break. My camera and notebook came out at once and never left my side for the entire trip. In quiet moments I sketched ideas and recorded the words spoken by Katrina survivors and their rescuers.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to New York, without wasting a moment, I loaded my images onto the computer and gathered together my hand dyed fabrics.  Hours later I had several hundred photographs to go through, slowly taking in all the devastation yet again.  Over the course of the rest of the month of April and early May, working long hours and into the night, I began to â€œjournalâ€ my feelings and reactions into my quilt.\r\n\r\nAs I worked on the center image, a tree of life, it became clear to me that my spiritual and positive personal values would be paramount in this piece. My art quilt, Shalom Yâ€™All, was inspired by the overwhelmingly hopeful reactions of the Katrina victims themselves. Despite the hundreds of homes we saw that were uninhabitable, unrecognizable and stained with eight foot water marks, the people of New Orleans and Baton Rouge relentlessly greeted us with smiles and a booming â€œHi Yâ€™All! Welcome to New Orleans!â€\r\n\r\nOne request repeated over and over by the Katrina survivors was â€œTell our story.â€ It was important for me to speak for these now powerless and abandoned people. â€œShalom Yâ€™allâ€, therefore, includes quotes from, among others, a New Orleans Reverend, A Baton Rouge Rabbi and our own youths and adults.  Most importantly, the quilt reverberates with the promise I made to tell their story.  Included in the quilt is a selection of photographs, both painful and uplifting:\r\n\r\nhomes ripped apart from the earth, a torn, moldy prayer shawl rescued from a synagogue in New Orleans, relocated children and their families living in crowded trailers, a levee that was breeched during hurricane Katrina, an abandoned school bus, uprooted massive trees, Katrina survivors, as well pictures of our teens doing work in a soup kitchen, gardening in a destroyed artistsâ€™ warehouse and handing out gifts brought with us to lift the spirits of the survivors. \r\n\r\nThe center of the quilt is my own visceral reaction to this mission. An excerpt reads:\r\n\r\nâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦I went wanting â€œto doâ€ something, anything.  We all brought smiles, hope, donations for children in FEMA trailers, needed supplies for adults; we helped garden and paint  in a ruined artist community, we met retired folks who were vibrant and rich with ideas and feelings, we met Jewish teens from Baton Rouge, heard speakers who repeatedly brought tears to our eyes, walked through homes no longer inhabitable and gasped our way through a moldy abandoned synagogue which broke my heart. But, no matter where we went we heard â€œthank you.â€ A story was told to us: New Orleans is awash in starfish that have come ashore; if we can put one starfish back into the ocean, we have done a mitzvah. I hope our starfish survive.\r\n\r\nI felt a strong desire to create this quilt and then give it away, insuring that I would keep my promise to have the Katrina victimsâ€™ voices be heard.  I was continuously motivated by my need to express my own sadness, confusion, and shock after visiting New Orleans.  I immersed myself intensely in this creative process and in doing so, worked through many of my own emotions.  My goal was always to be faithful to the people of New Orleans and Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n I wanted the piece to reflect my hope and theirs for renewal, growth and healing. I chose to begin the quilt with a large tree-of-life, a symbol of life cycles, nature, and strength.  Once I established this center core I was able to little by little add the words which were printed onto fabric.  The quotes are the thoughts gathered from our teens, adults and the people of Louisiana: \r\n\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t Forget About Usâ€¦Angels, Victims, Heroesâ€¦We came, we saw we weptâ€¦.Save a life and you save the world â€¦. Courage â€¦. Blessings â€¦.  Organized Determination â€¦.Rebuild one step at a timeâ€¦We shall be a light for all nations â€¦ Renewingâ€¦. Empathy â€¦ Mitzvotâ€¦ Humanity â€¦. Chesed â€¦ Solidarity â€¦ Tikkun Olam â€¦ War zone â€¦ Kindness â€¦. Overwhelmingâ€¦ I am coming home â€¦ I will rebuild New Orleans â€¦ Community â€¦ Nourishing the soul.â€\r\n\r\nJuxtaposed with the words are uplifting and disturbing photographs which reflect the dichotomy of my emotional experience.  I chose to use my own hand dyed fabrics and photographs with the exception of two, which I was given permission to use. The entire piece is fused, appliquÃ©d and free motion quilted using cotton, variegated and metallic threads.  I embellished the tree leaves with Swarovski crystals to add light amidst such great natural destruction. \r\n\r\nI am proud of Shalom Yâ€™All and the integrity with which it was created. I wanted to donate it to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) as my thanks for enriching my life and that of my daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed my wish to the Director of the Teen Leadership program, she gratefully accepted the piece for display in the UJA office in my local community of Mount Kisco, New York. It is deeply gratifying to know that Shalom Yâ€™All  will be in loving hands. The quilt will be viewed during formal business meetings, informal gatherings, ongoing UJA planning committees and a myriad of events, thereby helping to keep my promise to tell the story to as many people as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I have given my artwork to organizations related to events in my life. In 2003, I donated four Quilts of Love. These quilts were lovingly created with students who drew various images depicting Jewish history, tradition, and culture on fabric squares. I conceived these quilts in honor of my older daughterâ€™s Bat Mitzvah. The quilts were carried by hand to Tel Hashomer-Shiba Hospital/Rehabilitation Center outside of Tel Aviv, to Rambam Hospital in Haifa, the Childrenâ€™s Pavilion, Israel and to a school in Rishon Lezion Israel where they are displayed in a room built in memory of students killed while serving in the Israeli Army.  \r\n\r\nIn 2005, I created a tree-of-life quilt titled Hands of Love in honor of my younger daughterâ€™s Bat Mitzvah, The hands in the trees are  tracings of childrenâ€™s hands It is installed in the Rehovot Yourth Center, Rehovot, Israel.  In 2005 and 2006 I donated my art work to the Friends of the Israeli Defense Force auctions. This organization raises money for the widows and orphans of fallen Israel soldiers.  \r\n\r\nOn Wed, June 14th, 2006, Shalom Yâ€™All, will be officially unveiled at the Annual UJA Dinner, where it will be viewed by several hundred UJA donors.  My husband and children as well as my parents have been invited to participate in this very important event. I believe that as an artist I have a responsibility to give back to my community. I am grateful to be told that my artwork inspires others and makes people feel good about themselves and their lives. The benefits for me are that simple. Each time I donate, I receive much more than I give.\r\n\r\nSusan Schrott \r\n\r\nJune 1st 2006\r\n\r\nWestchester, New York\r\n\r\n');

There are some addresses in my e-mail address book that were automatically added over the years so I apologize if this e-mail is "inappropriate." \r\n \r\nAlso, I am very appreciative of all of your calls and e-mails. IF I do not respond to each, please know I have read them all and try to respond to each even if it is just one word but it is very difficult as my time is so limited. I know that sounds weird as I have no place to go...but I do have to keep moving ''forward.'' \r\n \r\nSo it is now one week since this disaster occurred and it is a disaster. Please continue to watch MSNBC (I find their coverage one of the best), FOX, CNN, whatever.  We must all bear witness to this tragedy and know how many are affected and how BAD it is for everyone. Frankly, although it is incredibly depressing, it is also necessary for us to know how many OTHERS are affected and how. \r\n \r\nHere are some random thoughts....I just cannot write all of my thoughts:\r\nfor the general population: no...medicine, insulin, food, health care, home, phone, family (they are scattered around the country), money!...you know the rest....it is beyond horrible and sad and impossible to comprehend. \r\n \r\nOn a VERY personal and somewhat self-centered note here are my personal thoughts with regard to my family: no way to go ''home'' (at least I do have a home to go to), the girls'' clothes are limited-we thought we were going to be gone 2-3 days max., for the girls-no friends-they are scattered all over the country, no homecoming, no school football games, no SAT course, no AP courses, nothing as they knew it in their life before, no way to know if their lives will ever be ''normal'' again. \r\n \r\nSorry for the rambling but that is how it goes......each day I wake up and think what can I do today to be productive in making our life as settled and OK here in Houston as possible. \r\n \r\nTo say it is difficult is an understatement. Life goes on for those around "US" but not for "US". Yesterday one of Sophie''s best friends arrived. There are a few of both Zoe and Sophie''s friends here but for the most part they are all over in: Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Dallas, SC, NJ, MA, you name it. \r\n \r\nAnd will our city survive. Many people will not return. The man I met at the CVS was a teacher and has a job in AL and has bought a house. A family I know and just heard from has bought a house in NJ.\r\n \r\nTo say we are unsettled is an extreme understatement. Because we cannot receive cell phone calls we do not know where MANY of our friends are.\r\n \r\nPLEASE if you are one of ''US" please go get a local-non New Orleans number. you can get a "pay as you go" phone to just receive incoming calls. You can then call back from your ''regular'' phone.\r\n \r\nI just heard a report that the President will not go to New Orleans as protection is not possible...that the police have shot 5 people who were shooting on contractors who were trying to repair the levee with the corp of engineers. AND that 2 police officers have taken their own lives...including the police spokesperson who I knew personally and was an incredible man.....can you imagine....IT IS BAD!!!! \r\n \r\nFinally, if you are part of the Jewish Community...GO TO THE LOCAL FEDERATION...NOW!!!!!  In EACH city they have been amazing, incredible, beyond supportive. There are crisis support teams that can find you ANYTHING you need. So far in Houston they have done more than you can even begin to IMAGINE!!! Knowing that they are there for you will be a comfort that cannot describe. They WANT to help. Let them. They know their city and they know how to get things done...and at a time like this.....we need help. \r\n \r\nAND finally, be in touch. The Jewish Federation is trying to compile a data base of where ''we'' all are. They are working out of the Houston Federation office. 713-729-7000. They even had a desk set up at the best deli in the city - Kenny and Ziggy''s!!! \r\n \r\nOK-my last thought.....I am fragile and sad.....have patience with me.....we need each other and you!  It is difficult for me. I cry a lot and I am trying to move forward....but there is no real forward yet.\r\n \r\nLove to all,\r\nJulie\r\n \r\n');

But, unless you are in an area that has a lot of us "displaced" people from the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, the news has become much more scarce.\r\n \r\nAs time has passed, the tragedy has not. Most of us are some combination of: sad, depressed, angry, confused, hurt, resentful, frustrated, heartbroken or scared.  Our businesses are in jeopardy, if not gone. Our homes are damaged or submerged and destroyed or just gone.....Our kids are scared and confused.....\r\n \r\nBut we also are TRYING to feel optimistic, hopeful, secure, happy, positive.  We want to get back home and rebuild our wonderful city but we cannot yet.  It is still submerged in parts....toxic in some areas.\r\n \r\nHad it not been for the levee breaking, the city would have been damaged, but not almost destroyed. There are so many parts of the city which are ''gone'' and many of those are residential. There are so many who will be homeless...who may never come back to the city, because they have no where to go.\r\n \r\nNew Orleans is  very lucky that many of the areas that were not affected are some of the oldest neighborhoods. The French Quarter has damage but it is not devastated . So here is the bright spot....there  IS always something to make your day light up with hope and love and which  makes you keep going because EVEN IN THE FACE OF SO MUCH LOSS, SO MUCH TRAGEDY, SO MUCH PAIN, ''good stuff DOES happen''...\r\n \r\nOn Friday I stood on the tarmac of the UPS-United Parcel Service''s main shipping area of the region. I accompanied some of the Emery-Weiner Jewish Day school students.  I was lucky enough to be there only because at the last minute the school needed another driver and I was at school and volunteered.  I thought I was just driving on a small ''field trip'', little did I know that what I was about to witness would impact me like no other ''field trip''!!!\r\n \r\nThere we stood and watched a 757 jumbo UPS plane land. The pilots had donated their time. UPS donated the planes-worth a few million dollars.  And on that plane was 25 tons of supplies that were collected in ONE WEEK by the 700 students of the San Diego Jewish ACADEMY Day School. Eighteen  wheelers then drove out the supplies to the Houston Food Bank and the Interfaith ministries headquarters. One of the drivers was a man from New Orleans. displaced,  who had been a UPS driver and now had no idea where he would now live. \r\n \r\nA few days ago I tried to get into uptown New Orleans with my husband and my brother-in-law (who had flown down from Boston to help us here in Houston). We flew to Jackson, MS and rented a car...the only car available which I found by luck after 20 calls. We drove 6 hours-usually 3 hours. No problem getting into the ''suburbs'' but when we tried to cross the line(border) from Jefferson Parish into Orleans Parish at a military check point, we were not permitted to enter. Suffice it to say we did make it in...Marshall and Kevin before me.  I could not stand being left behind so I followed....It was scary to say the least BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO GO HOME...IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD I LEFT BEHIND IN SUCH A HURRY AND WITH SO MUCH FEAR AND ANXIETY..... BUT wouldn''t you know......I was rescued from walking for 2 miles to my house by an Israeli film crew who drove me directly to my front door...Folks, you know I could NOT make up that story!!!!\r\n \r\nMIRACLES SHOW UP IN THE STRANGEST OF PLACES AND FOR THIS I AM GRATEFUL.  I AM ALSO GRATEFUL FOR ALL YOUR LOVE, YOUR CONCERN AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HELP US REBUILD OUR LIVES.\r\n \r\nJulie\r\n');

That means that Louisiana at this moment is receiving very high winds and a lot of rain. I just heard that one of the levees has failed and that the 9th ward area is beginning to get more water flowing into that neighborhood. Because of the circulation of the storm, counter-clockwise, the brunt of the storm is now hitting Louisiana.\r\n \r\nHurricane Rita''s center is heading toward Galveston,TX and Lake Charles,LA. Houston began to TRY to evacuate last Wednesday. The traffic was horrible. My Mom drove 12 hours to Austin and it is usually (I''m told) a 3 hour drive. My friend Lindsay Lanaux drove out at 3AM and made it as far as Beaumont, usually 1&1/2 hours, by 8AM and then sat in traffic  not moving for 2 hours. She turned back to Houston which is looking like a fairly safe place to be at this point.\r\n \r\nHere is my personal situation......my 2 daughters-Zoe,16 and Sophie,15 and I are in Florida in Delray Beach and Aventura. We evacuated from Houston, this time by air. We were in line at the airport in the sun and heat for 5 hours and then in a security line for another hour. I was ''talked into leaving'' Thursday early  morning and packed up at 8AM and went to the airport at 9. We had no traffic as were headed South to Hobby and not the larger airport which is North. A couple of days before the storm we booked the tickets. By Tuesday-the storm was expected to hit on Saturday-there were NO flights to anywhere.\r\n \r\nHow horrible is this situation! The Houston Communtiy has been an amazing support to ALL of us from Louiisana and the Gulf coast, and now they are in an evacuation! The Jewish Federation of Houston has housed and supported the entire staff from New Orleans. Now everyone has had to leave Houston. The New Orleans staff has a large conference room which has been turned into a command central office complete with computers, faxes, etc.\r\n \r\nThe evacuation from Galveston and the Houston area has been a nightmare. The roads are completely tied up. There is NO gas anywhere. People are stranded all over the highways. A bus carrying elderly evacuees from Houston exploded and almost everyone was killed.\r\n \r\nThe storm will be past the coast by tonight and we will know what damage Hurricane Rita has done. It will be inland by Saturday night and will be still be a major problem for a few days as it travels northward.\r\n \r\nAnd again, on a very personal note, for those of you who are products of UJC''s\r\nNational Young Leadership Cabinet, you know that you are blessed, as I am. The support from my cabinet chevre has been incredible. I will not name you all, but your calls and e-mails have been an amazing comfort. Thank you for all that you have done. It has been a live-support system that I has made this ordeal somewhat bearable...I love you all!\r\n \r\nSo keep us-the entire New Orleans, Houston-and surrounding area,Texas, and Louisiana, and the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf coast Communities in your thoughts and prayers.\r\n \r\nShabbat Shalom,\r\nJulie\r\n');

Unless of course we have another natural disaster that displaces us yet once again!\r\n \r\nIt has now been a full month since I very reluctantly left my home and set out on an endless journey.\r\nIt has been an extremely difficult time in our lives.\r\n \r\nIt is NOT about ME.....My house is fine, a bit of damage but no flooding. We now have electricity, or so I am told. There was looting in uptown but I think my area was spared because of the National Guard traffic in the park which my house faces onto.\r\n \r\nIt IS about the thousands of displaced people who have no home to go back to but continue to hope. That somehow when they are allowed into their neighborhood they might find something left to cherish. A photograph, a favorite blanket, something....In my opinion the only thing that they can hope for is good memories of the great life in their home which is now gone.\r\n \r\nIt is about Jesse. A banquet captain from the Omni Royal Orleans. He is still living in a shelter in Houston waiting for the OK to enter New Orleans. There he waits everyday with his 2 daughters and his granddaughter. Waiting to go "home." And that is how we feel about our city-it is HOME....even in a disastrous status.\r\n \r\nThe mayor is opening parts of the city. Those that are "safe." Of course there is no water to drink or even was with. You can flush a toilet or put out a fire, but according to some the water supply is still contaminated. Others say it is fine and are showering in it, although not drinking it yet!\r\n \r\nAnd the Gulf coast of Mississippi-it was decimated. Entire blocks are just GONE. The Oreck plant is there, but sustained little damage. However the infrastructure of the area is severely diminished. For more info see the Wall Street Journal article............(joann to help add a link or just reference when it was in the WSJ)....................................................The main offices were based in New Orleans (in Jefferson Parish) and have been operating temporarily in Dallas. They will likely reopen in New Orleans (Jefferson Parish) in 2 weeks or less!\r\n \r\nAnd then there was Rita. Headed directly at us in the Houston area. Again, I was not going to leave...But off we went to Florida where we have so many friends and it was wonderful. But for the first 24 hours all we could do was worry about those left in the area where the storm was headed. Galveston and Houston were spared but the Southwest part of Louisiana was demolished. Again, in a subculture that was the heart and soul of the area. It is Cajun country, and they say no matter what, they will rebuild and make their lives in the same spot they have lived since exiled from Canada!\r\n \r\nSo too, for those in St. Bernard parish, and the 9th Ward...they hope to do the same.....but frankly I hold little hope. It truly breaks my heart when I think of the families whose lives are shattered. Who have lived in that area for generations. How can they rebuild? I don''t think there will be a house that can be saved for miles. I think they will all be demolished.\r\n \r\nAnd I think of the elderly couple who I met at the Hilton at Hobby airport. When I went to the Hobby (the smaller airport close the center of the city), there was NO place to park. People were just abandoning their cars in illegal spots, realizing they would be towed but having no choice. I drove around for an hour and then saw the Hilton. I pulled in and waited at the front desk while the elderly couple explained their plight. She had very bad eyesight. He had just had brain surgery 6 months ago. They were hoping for a room. The roads heading out of Houston were total parking lots...not moving. It took 3 hours to go 10 miles. This very well-dressed, dignified couple were out of gas and had NO place to go. The front desk attendant gave them directions to a gas station she heard had gas...most were sold out.....and her phone number and told them to keep calling and she would see what she could do if they could not find something.....\r\n \r\nFor me, I asked if I could rent a room, even if there was not one available, just so I could park my car in their lot! They said to go ahead and park and to put a security card on the front dashboard and then come back and they would take me back to the airport in their van!!!! OH, and when I returned, just to call and they would pick me up. At that point I didn''t know if there would be a car to come back to. Would it be flooded? Gone? Would a tree branch slam into it????\r\n \r\nSo, of course the end of the story is that Houston was spared, as was my car. I have no idea what happened to the elderly couple. I do know Jesse is still waiting for St. Bernard Parish to open. Zoe, Sophie and I had a lovely time with our friends in Delray, Aventura and Miami. We were, and are still a bit fragile and ''shell-shocked.''\r\n \r\nAnd we just want to go HOME! The girls want to go to Newman School. I want to go to meetings. We want to run errands, like to Langensteins for Popeye dip! I want to know what happened to my friend who does alterations and I want to have friends over for dinner. I want to see my friends who are scattered all over the country. We want to remember what it was like to be ''normal.'' I want to go to synagogue on Friday night-just because I can. I want the Jesses'' of the city to find something that will give them hope. I want the developers who come in to respect what the city was and to rebuild it with some concern and respect for those who have lost not just their home, but their neighborhood. I want all of you to come and visit and I want you all to continue to think of us-those who love our city New Orleans and who vow to rebuild.\r\n \r\nThe outpouring of love from all of you around the country and around the world has been amazing. We feel it, and see it. We thank you for EVERYTHING. For those of you who called and if I did not call back, I am sorry. For those of you who offered help, THANK YOU. \r\n \r\nFor all of you who are helping to maintain the infrastructure of our lives, the synagogues, the Jewish Federation, the JCC, JFS, ETC(!!!!!), the Food Bank, Covenant House-a home for homeless teens, the businesses functioning outside of New Orleans but who can soon reopen in the city. For those of you who not only welcomed us into your cities but into your schools and homes. For those of you who have volunteered, and/or given help financially...TO EVERYONE, FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE....THANK YOU SO MUCH.\r\n \r\nI do not think I will write another update. There is no need. We are settled here in Houston until the end of this semester. The expectation is that many schools will be open on January 3rd and we will move back home. Until then we will be in Houston, with a wonderful community who has been gracious beyond words.\r\n \r\nPlease pray for the people of New Orleans and the gulf coast region. Please keep us in your thoughts and keep up with how we are progressing. Please come and visit for Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest, or just to visit the city. We will be waiting with open arms and the warmth and love that is just good old Southern hospitality.\r\n \r\nAnd, as the song goes, ''Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans''????\r\nWell, I certainly do!!!!\r\n \r\nWith love and very sincerely,\r\n \r\nL''Shana Tova,\r\n \r\nJulie\r\n');

The journey was long, the training longer still.  The whole world was watching and listening.  He had plenty of time to prepare all aspects of the landing.  Thus, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped from ___ onto the moon and declared: â€œThatâ€™s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.â€   That is how it feels today.  New Orleans may feel somewhat unworldly, but each of us followed relatively normal actions to get here today.  We drove, we walked.  We greeted friends.  We welcomed guests.  We gathered to welcome a New Year in this beloved 176 year old congregation.  â€œOne small stepâ€¦â€  Yet, this is an historic moment, even for Touro Synagogue.  Today, we reclaim our holy space.  Today, the Jewish community of New Orleans joins our city in declaring that religious and communal life continues here.  Less than a week ago, electricity was restored to Touroâ€™s building.   Today, the Jewish community of New Orleans gathers to mark this holy time, to consider our individual lives, and to ponder our futures.  We are thankful for those able to celebrate with us from New Orleans and especially from beyond.  No one from New Orleans is a stranger here today.  However, we pause, again, to thank our guests.  Thank you to those who are here offering their medical, engineering, security and other expertise.  We are sorry that you canâ€™t be with your family this Rosh Hashanah.  We are moved to welcome you to our family.\r\n\r\nLooking back a month, we didnâ€™t really have time to rehearse for Katrina.  I leave the discussions of policy and engineering to others.  And sure, we had time to grab a briefcase of financial information, a few changes of clothing, and follow the contraflow pattern from New Orleans.   There were lessons, some had already learned.  The friend, who cleaned our kitchen two weeks ago, suggested that Debbie and I not leave fruit on the counter next time we evacuate.  However, nothing could have prepared us for the displacement, uncertainty, and trauma of these past weeks.  We are dealing with the coming weeks and months, but, again, we have no rehearsal time.  \r\nNew Orleans and its residents are simply living this time.  Even with preparation time, researchers and Neil Armstrong himself, suggest that he left out a planned word, â€œaâ€™â€”\r\nâ€œ a small step for man.â€ The phrase was intended to be â€œa small step for a man,â€ clearly emphasizing the astronaut himself.  If Armstrong could make such an error, than certainly we have had moments of failure in our time of chaos.  We should forgive and be forgiven for our lack of rehearsal, for our individual missteps and misspoken words over the past weeks.  After all, these are our days of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nOur rabbis viewed each and every Rosh Hashanah as an historic day.  They sense a potential in each New Year that led to epic pronouncements.  Thus do we read in our Shofar service:\r\nâ€œHayom Harat Haolam, On this day the world is born.  This day all creatures stand before You, whether as children or as servants.  As we are Your children, show us a parentâ€™s compassion.  As we are Your servants, we look to You for mercy: shed the light of your judgment upon us, O holy and awesome God.â€\r\n\r\nOn this New Year, we are much focused on our financial and physical situations.  Our attention is drawn to the condition of our city and our community.  However, our prayers remind us to be concerned about our own actions and intentions as a New Year dawns.  Our personal and communal concerns overlap, as well they should.  Hayom Harat Haolam, the First of Tishri offers us a new time of potential and opportunity.  Chaos preceded Biblical creation.  Chaos has certainly come before this holiday.  Genesis would have us imagine that the seven days of creation set all in order, but we have always suspected it was a bit more complicated. \r\n\r\nIn part, our human situation is complicated by differing situations and perspectives.  The residents of New Orleans share a common fate.  Yet, we differ in our economic and family situations.  Katrina impacted our homes and business differently, and somewhat randomly.  As we know, oneâ€™s situation can influence oneâ€™s viewpoint.  Are you new to town or does your whole family live here?  Did you suffer tremendous loss or relatively normal hurricane damage?  \r\n \r\nIn far less extreme situations, perception depends on personal role.  Joan Didion compared her experience to that of her apartmentâ€™s doormen, when her husband John Gregory Dunne died.\r\nâ€œEight months later I asked the manager of our apartment building if he still had the log kept by the doormen for the night of December 30â€¦According to the log, the doormen that night were Michael Flynn and Vasile Ionescuâ€¦The log for that evening showed only two entries, fewer than usual, even for a time of the year when most people in the building left for more clement venues: â€œNOTE:-- Paramedics arrived at 9:20 p.m. for Mr. Dunne.  Mr. Dunne was taken to hospital at 10:05 p.m.  NOTE:-- Light bulb out on A-B passenger elevator.â€  (New York Times Magazine, September 25, 2005, p.44) \r\n\r\nOur city is filled with many complicating factors beyond human perspective.  Thus, we doubt those who believe that any one day, any short period of time can truly transform existence.  Each Rosh Hashanah, we should hear in Hayom Harat Haolam, on this day the world was born, a statement of hope and reassurance, not of certainty.  Judaism is hopeful, but not composed of quick, over-arching promises, this or any year.  Rabbinic overstatements are meant to encourage, not to promise results.  It is in that frame of mind that we should hear the teaching of the 10th Century Rav Saadia Gaon:  â€œThe shofar foreshadows the end of the present world order and the inauguration of Godâ€™s reign of righteousness throughout the world.â€  (edited by Rabbi Dov Peretz Elkins, taken from www.myjewishlearning.com)  A new world doesnâ€™t dawn in one day.  Righteousness, rebuilding, and complete peace are still along way off.  However, today arrives bring the hope of refreshed potential, individual and communal possibility.\r\n\r\nWe need not wait until next Rosh Hashanah to feel this encouraging sense of renewal at a dark time.  Our tradition teaches us words to recite each morning, upon awakening:\r\nModeh Ani Lâ€™fanecha Melech Chai Vâ€™chayam, I thank You, O living God, Shehechazarta Bi Nishmaati Bâ€™chemla, for returning my soul to me.\r\nEach day, we awaken to miracle of rebirth.  Our ancestors were fearful of the night and amazed at the renewal of each day.  Again, hear these words as encouragement, not certainty.  \r\n \r\nAwakening after Katrina, days can feel heavy and hard.  Reality can be harsh.  Doubt and the need for a break are real and natural.  Our yearnings on these days are captured by the Israel poet Yehuda Amichai, in his last published work:\r\nâ€œSometimes my soul wants to get out of my body for a little run,\r\nlike a dog, and return calmer to the body.  But it worries\r\nthat it wonâ€™t find the way back.â€ \r\n(â€œThe Precision of Pain and the Blurriness of Joy: The Touch of Longing is Everywhereâ€ #9, Open Closed Open)\r\n\r\nWe may feel like escaping the moment we wake up.  We may wish for the gentle joy of running on the beach or taking a well-deserved nap, or even an undeserved one.  Caught running left and right, we dream of being calm.  Amichai captures are fear that life will rarely resemble â€œnormal.â€  Even the image of a dog running free has been transformed for our city.  Can we remember how to say, how to feel, Modeh Ani, thank you for the opportunity of a new day?\r\n\r\nThese Holy Days attempt an answer to that question.  Each day may be hard.  This year opens with acute difficulties.  Rosh Hashanah answers with a hope: Hayom Harat Haolam, On this day the world is born.  No quick solutions, but friends and family, congregations and a community struggling together.  On this historic Rosh Hashanah, may we recognize the potential of our lives and of each year.  May we acknowledge our situations and yet rise to the opportunities presented to us.\r\nMay this become a year of sweetness.\r\nLâ€™shanah Tovah uâ€™metuka\r\n');
INSERT INTO `metatext` (`metatext_id`, `metafield_id`, `object_id`, `metatext_text`) VALUES (417, 5, 210, 'New Orleans in Baton Rouge\r\nErev Rosh Hashanah\r\nOctober 2, 2005\r\nRabbi Andrew Busch, Touro Synagogue\r\nâ€œAnswering Rosh Hashanahâ€™s Callâ€\r\n\r\nSummer camp.  Usually these words make us think of sports, swimming, and making friends.  Our Reform Jewish Jacobs Camp adds a layer of singing, Jewish values, and staff drawn from own synagogues.  This summer, I joined Cantor Warner, and so many of our New Orleans synagogue professionals as faculty at Jacobs.  Being new to town when Katrina hit, my family evacuated to Jacobs.  There we weathered the storm as part of a Jewish community.  Camp also sheltered a group from a facility for developmental delayed adults.  In camp-style, we played ping-pong in the education center while the storm passed through Utica, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHaving found our way to Houston, many of us re-evacuated last weekend in the face of Rita.  My wife, Rabbi Debbie Pine, and I did the natural.  We retreated to Greene Family Camp, the Reform Jewish regional camp for Texas.  Originally, the camp expected 200 Jewish evacuees.  The camp director, rushing back from a meeting in New York, ordered up a full Shabbat dinner.  By the time the weekend arrived, the camp shelter community consisted of approximately 50 Jews and approximately 350 other evacuees, mostly Mexican Americans.  During Rita, Jacobs Camp also housed over 100 non-Jews escaping the brunt of the storm.\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the Jewish community were deputized as camp staff, helping with bedding, meal, and activities.  Debbie and I lead services and helped arrange for the Spanish speaking priest, who had evacuated to camp, to lead Christian services.  That experience foreshadowed the hospitality of this church.  It also calls to mind the kindness of the Baptist Church which has taken in Baton Rougeâ€™s Beth Shalom following the damage they sustained during Rita.  I know our hearts go out to the Jews of Baton Rouge, who have shown us so much kindness.\r\n\r\nOur impromptu, multi-cultural retreat had many highlights, especially as the storm skipped Waco all together.  Personally, I thought the real highlight of our Jewish camp gathering hundreds for a showing of â€œThe Incrediblesâ€ with Spanish subtitles and a make-your-own sundae bar.  Greeneâ€™s camp director focused on another memorable moment, the Havdallah service, which marked the end of that Shabbat:\r\nâ€œSaturday evening was very calmâ€¦About 60 people participated, of whom about 40 were non-Jewishâ€¦It was a very powerful moment especially because the non-Jews were very eager to participate: to pass the spice box and to hold the wine aloft during the blessing.â€\r\n\r\nWorship experiences often can present powerful memories.  We tend to envision our ideal services and ponder the memorable ones, poignant or unusual.  A displaced synagogue leader recently mentioned that she was dreaming of being back on her own congregationâ€™s bima, enjoying worship, complete with familiar clergy and dislocated friends.  I join in that hope.  Gathered here tonight, we dream: soft, easy visions and paralyzing, deeper fears.  Many of us may oscillate between the two sets of images.\r\n\r\nOur ancient rabbis recognized this possible roller-coaster of emotions, though I guess they wouldnâ€™t have called it a roller-coaster.  Through the ups and downs of their lives, they shaped and reshaped their inherited Biblical faith into a rhythm far more familiar to modern Jews.  The High Holy Days were developed as time to recalibrate our lives on a personal and communal level.  Our Yom Kippur prayers feature our failings and our need to improve.  However, the Day of Atonement and Rosh Hashanah are tempered by the sweet thought that we have some hope for the future. In Hebrew and English tonight, we declared our deepest dreams and hopes as a community and as individuals.\r\nâ€œZochreinu Lâ€™chaim, Remember us unto life, O Sovereign, who delights in life, and inscribe us in the Book of Life, O God of Life.â€\r\nThat dear hope for life and a secure future is amplified by the final hope of Avinu Malkeinu:  â€œTreat us generously and with kindness, be our help.â€\r\n \r\nWe know that we need help moving forward.  However, these prayers assert the vision that we are worthy of receiving assistance.  Despite our current personal states, we can reach for God and be received.  Despite our communityâ€™s diaspora, we can reach for each other and be found.  Rosh Hashanah offers opportunities of reaching and finding.\r\n\r\nSearching for God and meaning at this moment is not easy.  Reaching out for others can be complicated by a desire to pull back into a more solitary pose.  We are tempted to care only for our own needs, yet look out and see others in need of aid.  We are drawn towards familiar faces but understand that strangers may need help; may offer aid.  So tempting it is to give in to pessimism, presented as pragmatism.  However, the High Holy Days teach us to be realistic and hopeful when approaching a New Yearâ€™s challenges.  Rabbi Kerry Olitzky and Carol Ochs encourage with the following words:\r\nâ€œA free fall into the pit of hopelessness can shock us into searching for a new hope.  At the very moment when we would rather just disappear from the face of the earth, we suddenly know it is up to us to strive and to succeed.  The existentialist philosopher Jean Paul Sartre noted profoundly: â€œHuman life begins on the far side of despair.â€â€\r\n						(Jewish Spiritual Guidance, p.127)\r\n\r\nOne way of addressing despair has been in finding each other: a neighbor or secretary, close family or mere acquaintance.  Finding each other is a form of human support, though I acknowledge that some reunions will be impossible or postponed.  For those in Baton Rouge, Houston, or Metairie, we meet each other running our endless errands.  For those spread further, the chance encounters are fewer.  However, in meeting one another, we may still feel alone.  Even in tonightâ€™s communal embrace, we are lost in our own thoughts. The rabbis bequeathed us High Holy Days which provide space for both the public and private aspects of this experience.  Together, let us support each other in moving forward, slowly, with setbacks, but moving forward.  That is the opportunity Rosh Hashanah provides to cherish our dreams, acknowledge our nightmares, and move ahead.  As Rabbi Michael Strassfeld wrote: \r\n \r\nâ€œRosh Hashanah is a call to change, a crying out for hope even in the bleakest landscapes.  In response, the people of Israel stir in their sleep, aroused by dreams carried by the music and memories of this season.  But then they turn over, pulling the blankets of the familiar more tightly around themselves, hoping to once again fall back asleep.â€\r\n							(A Book of Life, p.264)\r\n\r\nThe sweetness of apples and honey is meant to combat the bleak landscapes and harsh disappointments Katrina has wrought.  At the same time, Rosh Hashanah attempts to draw our dreams into context.  We must balance our visions and actions, as we look for personal comfort in this world.  \r\n\r\nMaimonides, the greatest of Jewish thinkers, understood Rosh Hashanahâ€™s shofar as a direct challenge to the temptation to fall asleep in the face of lifeâ€™s difficulties.  He counseled against a slumber drawn from escapism or avoidance.  Our High Holy Day prayerbook includes Maimonidesâ€™ words in our Shofar service:  â€œAwake, you sleepers, from your sleep!  Rouse yourselves, you slumberers.â€  The penetrating call of the shofar is meant to reach deep down and call us to attention.  Our attention is to be focused on and beyond our own lives and our own circle, towards the world and humanity around us.  The 12th Century philosopher, called us to live up to our highest selves, regardless of circumstances.  There are three sections to a shofar service.  The first reminds of Godâ€™s majesty in the world.  We donâ€™t need a reminder of the power of Creation, and yet we are reminded that there is a power beyond Creation, beyond our comprehension.  The second section of the Shofar service speaks of memory.  It is easy to think that the memory should be a human one of loves, communities, and opportunities lost.  However, this section of the service is really taking note of the potential value of our lives. What we can accomplish, together not alone, can rise to a cosmic value.  Tomorrowâ€™s shofar service will remind us that proper human action can have a true impact in our chaotic world.  The third section, Shofarot, speaks to the shofarâ€™s call itself.  So much can not be put into words.  So many thoughts are expressed best with a hug or a hammer.  There is so much potential just beyond our fingertips, if we could just find a way to tap into it.  \r\n \r\nThese messages of personal significance and communal potential are reinforced throughout Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.  We find echoes in Avinu Malkeinu and next weekâ€™s Al Chet, in the Biblical passages, meals and fast of these holy days.  Tekiah and Teruah wait until tomorrow morning.  However, the shofarâ€™s message is woven through this seasonâ€™s practices.\r\n\r\nWe should be reminded each year, regardless of circumstance, that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur are about our lives and beyond our lives.  The hard work of honest Tikkun Olam, helping to mend a world, imperfect even before the hurricane, can also add strength to our personal journey.  We are not the only ones to pray.  The hopes of our melodies and worship echo the hopes of all who share our community.  We move forward not only on our own terms, but also through caring about the needs of others.  Specific actions are still hard to conceptualize at this moment, but our moving ahead can not be only for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis broadest message of Rosh Hashanah brings me back to camp.  We should be moved by the Union for Reform Judaismâ€™s Jacobs Ladder program, speared headed by J.C., Jonathan Cohen, the director of our Jacobs Camp.  As we care for ourselves and accept the aid of others, our movement is helping in the general relief effort.  Using a warehouse in Utica, Mississippi, Jacobs and our movement are making a real difference, moving tons of donated goods from around the country.  They are making sure that those who need basic supplies receive some of them, while making sure that Jewish groups are part of the relief effort.  In this way, we are reminded of the interconnection of human strangers.  \r\n\r\n \r\nOn a more festive and quieter level, the challot that will be distributed tonight are symbols of the outpouring of Jewish support for our shared plight.  A woman in Baton Rouge has a cousin, who is a baker in New York.  The cousin called offering to bake and send donated challot for the New Year.  She thought the offer was for a few dozen.  It turned out to be for 1,000 challot.  Eat them, use them for Tashlich, but know that in our loneliness, we are not alone.  These loaves represent the tip of an iceberg of support for us, for our communities, for our region.  We have been reading of, listening to, and experiencing that very assistance.  And know, that the wiser ones who offer material assistance, know that it can never be enough on many levels.  We knew during Rita the limitations of our offerings to those Mexican Americans, some of whose lives were being radically transformed by the storm.  Yet we gave, just as others continue to give.  Just as our own New Orleans community would give to others, given the chance.\r\n\r\nSome Jews from New Orleans may scowl at the thought of celebrating tonight, given our circumstances.  In their sadness and anger, they miss the historic connections and supports of this day.  Celebrating our holidays can provide a sense of community, compassion and hope.  Working to care for others, now and in the future, can create a shape and meaning in our individual lives.  Despair is real.  Questions remain.  However, Rosh Hashanah arrives as a â€œcall to changeâ€ for those who have had too much change already.  The New Year beckons with a â€œcrying out for hope,â€ even if it is muffled.  In this New Year, 5766, may the Jews of New Orleans be among those who answer the call and heed the cry.  We deserve it and so do those around us.\r\nLâ€™shanah tovah. \r\n');
INSERT INTO `metatext` (`metatext_id`, `metafield_id`, `object_id`, `metatext_text`) VALUES (418, 5, 211, 'Kol Nidre 5766\r\nNew Orleans in Houston\r\nOctober 12, 2005\r\nRabbi Andrew Busch, Touro Synagogue\r\n\r\n\r\nA new year, a new rabbi.  A year, which despite its unusual nature, highlights some very old problems and, maybe even, opportunities.  Together, we worship on this Yom Kippur for the very first time.  My family and I have been moved by the outgoing, open nature of the New Orleans Jewish community.  From before we moved from Philadelphia this summer, we were touched by your attention to details and your concern, all done in New Orleans fashion.  Touro Synagogueâ€™s Welcoming Committee made sure our new home had a well-stocked fridge, including a couple of dozen bottles of wine.  During our first week in town, my parents called and asked where the kids were.  I told them they were out riding the street car.  â€œWho were they with?,â€ came the question.  Frankly, I didnâ€™t know the answer, but since Micki Bronston had sent them it was okay.  That conversation was echoed several times that week, not that I really knew Micki, Ben, or any of those who so warmly welcomed us to town. You just put us at ease.\r\n\r\nEase does not come naturally tonight.  I am acutely aware of Touro Synagogueâ€™s 176 year history.  Additionally, this Yom Kippur arrives, with most of you having not heard me last week in Baton Rouge or New Orleans.  However, all of us should draw strength from the 250 worshippers gathered in Touroâ€™s chapel last week.  I voice my respect for the other rabbis in our community, their strong personalities and deep legacies.  Also, Cantor Warner and I are leading just our 10th communal service together, if I count correctly.  One of those was sharing the pulpit at Beth Israel last month.  Seth brings such talent and commitment to this entire community, as he has helped welcome me and prepare for these unusual holy days.  Ease may not be natural, but a strange feeling of luck does come upon me.  Luck?  Well yes, to be together with so many wonderful people from so many historic congregations.  To be blessed with this opportunity to worship thanks to Rice University and the Union for Reform Judaism.  To be embraced so fully by the Jewish community of Houston, and of Baton Rouge, Jackson, Memphis, and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis mixture of blessings and luck (good and bad) bring us to the proper role of Yom Kippur in our lives.  The Day of Atonement serves as a chance to take stock of our lives and our world.  For each of us, our prayers offer the chance to recalibrate our behavior.  Lists and alphabets of transgressions pass before us.  We are encouraged to be honest about the entire past year (not just the past month).  The New Year, 5766, presents itself as chance to do better, for missteps months old or for misstatements of the past weeks themselves.  In that way, this year is no different than any other.\r\n\r\nâ€œAtem Nitzavim Hayom, You stand here this day,â€ thus will tomorrow morningâ€™s Torah portion call us to attention.  Deuteronomy acknowledges our diversity, yet attempts to unite our community.  Each Yom Kippur gathers a room of people whose lives have taken divergent paths, whose spirits are in different places.  This awareness is all the more acute this evening.  We stand here this day.  Those of us whose lives survived relatively intact are touched by the appreciation of those who have suffered worse.  In reverse, we are saddened to the core for those whose homes, businesses, and families are so upended.  Yom Kippur draws us together in consideration and in mutual support.  This yearâ€™s context is extreme, but a diversity of experience greets each New Year.\r\n\r\nNew to town, I didnâ€™t plan to comment much on New Orleans this first Yom Kippur.  Thanks to Katrina, my familyâ€™s short stay in New Orleans, already qualifies us to discuss the cityâ€™s great disaster as well as the next guy.  I donâ€™t go back generations in Louisiana, but my hopes and fears are now linked to yours and to our all-too-interesting city.  We have different experiences and views, but we all stand here this day.  Yom Kippur challenges us to take of our city, not just our own lives.\r\n\r\nLast year at this time, Rabbi Goldstein shared yet another of his famous Kol Nidre letters.  It was his custom to shape a sermon positioned as an open letter and therein to capture an important theme of the moment.  I have been asked if I would compose a letter this evening.  I considered his or a similar format.  Unfortunately, the U.S. Postal Service has forwarded few of our letters in the past month, our internet service has been spotty, and I have far exceeded the minutes on my cell phone.  \r\nConsidering our communityâ€™s history and present, I find a different point of contact with my so supportive predecessor.  I find encouragement not in a letter, but in the writings of Henry Slonimsky, a Jewish scholar who inspired Rabbi Goldstein as well.  In a 1954 explanation of Judaism, Slonimsky wrote â€œA great religion should glorify life.  The hardships and tragedies of life are not arguments against life.â€  (Essays, p.138)\r\n\r\nDo we despair of our ability to answer fateâ€™s challenge to our fairly settled lives?  Judaism would answer no, while acknowledging that our response may not be particularly chipper at this moment?  Do we fold in the face of the tremendous challenges to our community and our city?  Again, Judaism would understand our slow pace and setbacks, but would encourage us ever forward.  We stand here this day and take stock of our community.  Slonimsky drew a connection to the morningâ€™s portion.  In Deuteronomy 30, we will read â€œuâ€™vacharta bachaim, choose life,â€ what he considered to be our religionâ€™s â€œproudestâ€ instruction.  We may not have a detailed plan, but we can choose life together, striving forward to create and recreate our city.\r\n\r\nThe need to recreate New Orleans draws us to one of its oldest problems. The past month makes this issue unavoidable, despite my short tenure.  Phone calls from dear friends echoed what I heard in the media.  Fingers were pointed.  Anne Rice, an author I have never read, captured the accusatory tone so well on September 3rd in the New York Times:\r\nâ€œAlmost as soon as the cameras began panning over the rooftops, and the helicopters began chopping free those trapped in their attics, a chorus of voices rose.  "Why didn''t they leave?" people asked both on and off camera. "Why did they stay there when they knew a storm was coming?" One reporter even asked me, "Why do people live in such a place?"â€  Rice continued: â€œHow could these thieves loot and pillage in a time of such crisis? How could people shoot one another? Because the faces of those drowning and the faces of those looting were largely black faces, race came into the picture. What kind of people are these, the people of New Orleans, who stay in a city about to be flooded, and then turn on one another?â€\r\nMy answer came quickly, maybe because I was new to town.  The speedy answer of one defending a choice, but also a response developed in our recent Philadelphia suburb, where red hair would qualify as diversity.  The answer is that New Orleans is different than much of America, but how different do our fellow citizens think we really are?  We have each had our own answer to the question raised from San Francisco, Boston, or Cleveland.\r\nFor herself, Rice replied sharply:\r\nâ€œThousands didn''t leave New Orleans because they couldn''t leave. They didn''t have the money. They didn''t have the vehicles. They didn''t have any place to go. They are the poor, black and white, who dwell in any city in great numbers; and they did what they felt they could do - they huddled together in the strongest houses they could find. There was no way to up and leave and check into the nearest Ramada Inn.â€\r\nThis answer focuses national attention on the economic gaps across our great nation.  Despite New Orleansâ€™ embarrassing statistics, letâ€™s not pretend that the rest of the country is so fabulous on economic issues.  The United States, not just our city, possesses complicated problems of fairness, income, housing, and health care.  I didnâ€™t plan on speaking of poverty this first year.  However, I arrived intrigued by the challengs in New Orleans to confront the intertwined issues that we might call poverty.  Linked so tightly to the urban fabric, the opportunities are at our fingertips.  Katrina breaks the dialogue wide open.  \r\nHowever, poverty does not live in isolation.  Another partial answer to the past monthsâ€™ questions can be found in the linkage between poverty and race in America.  Why so many black faces in the photos during the stormâ€™s several weeks of national attention?  Well, we know the demographics of New Orleans.  However, let the countryâ€™s other major cities not hide from a fair comparison.  Jonathan Kozol, the education policy critic and author, observes in his recently published work, The Shame of the Nation:\r\nâ€œIn Chicago, by the academic year 2000-2001, 87 percent of the public school enrollment was black or Hispanic; less than 10 percent of the children in the schools were whiteâ€¦ In St. Louis, 82 percent of the student population was black or Hispanic by this point, in Philadelphia and Cleveland 78 percent, in Los Angeles 84 percent, in Detroit 95 percent, in Baltimore 88 percent.  In New York, nearly three quarters of the students were black or Hispanic in 2001â€¦.A teacher at P.S.65, one of the South Bronx elementary schools, once pointed out to me one of the two white children I had ever seen thereâ€¦â€Iâ€™ve been at this school for 18 years,â€ she said.  â€œThis is the first white student I have ever taught.â€â€ (p.8)\r\n\r\nIf schools hold our future, they are also a snap-shot of our present.  We have a country that is split in sections, and the divide is getting ever wider.  Yes, there are poor whites and successful members of other groups.  However, we know that our inner-cities have been abandoned by whites and the schools are a solid barometer of the economic-racial intersection.  If anything, part of what drew my family to New Orleans was that despite the racial divide, you as a community had not abandoned the city as a whole. \r\n\r\nOur understanding of Judaism should lead us to rebuild our lives and our community, while ensuring that the New Orleans of the future is a place of promise for all its residents.  We should draw upon our Reform Jewish heritage to insist that our city addresses racial and economic disparities.  Great work has been done over the last century, and our grandparents would not recognize our world.  Yet, we should not allow the promises and actions of the past to lead us to complacency.  Things are still not fair in our city, in this city, or in any city.  Historic battles are left unfinished, or worse.\r\n\r\nThe landmark Brown v. Board of Education was heard in 1952.  â€œWhen asked by Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter for his definition of "equal" during oral arguments in the case, counsel Thurgood Marshall replied, "Equal means getting the same thing, at the same time and in the same place."  (URJ Religious Action Center materials)  \r\nWe are encouraged by that principle.  However, Jonathan Kozol observes that the shadows of the later Supreme Court Justice Marshall and other civil rights greats have become unfortunately ironic:\r\nâ€œThere is a bit of painful humor that Iâ€™ve heard from black schoolteachers who grew up during the era of the integration movement and have subsequently seen its goals abandoned and its early victories reversed.  â€œIf you want to see a really segregated school in the United States today, start by looking for a school thatâ€™s name for Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks.â€  (p.24)\r\nRacial divisions are real in our nation, despite the advances of the past decades.  This issues plays out differently in each city, but it is never absent.  The accusations of friends and the media are overblown, but speak to real flaws in New Orleans.  As we move ahead, we can not ignore the past or the context.  We can not ignore our human failings and our basic natures.\r\n\r\nWe gravitate towards those who seem similar to us, in so many ways.  Thus, our machzor, our prayerbook, mentions xenophobia.  Racism is simply a form of domestic xenophobia.  Perceived differences make us uneasy..  This issue is not unique to New Orleans.  It is embedded throughout our land.  Nothing is worth the price of Katrina and her impact.  However, maybe it will be yet another wake-up call to our nation about the costs of ignoring racism and its related issues: education, housing, even opportunity.  I am not an expert with a  plan, but I know that we as a community must be engaged.\r\n\r\nAs with my own life, I donâ€™t propose a detailed plan at this juncture.  We stand here this day, still in the tail of the storm.  In some ways, this Yom Kippur is like any other.  We should consider our actions and reactions.  We should take stock of our lives.  However, this Yom Kippur clearly arrives at an extreme moment for us.  Katrina, its destruction and dislocation should act as a catalyst towards considering the nature of our very society.  As we make plans for the future of our lives and our community, we should also accept the challenge of Americaâ€™s oldest dilemmas.  The quality of our future and our city will be judged, in part, on how it confronts issues of racism and poverty.  This same test continues for the entire United States.  May 5766 be a year of successful rebuilding in our lives.  May this year be one in which we confront the deepest issues of our land.  Most importantly, may this become a year of sweetness and peace.  Gamar Chatima Tova, May we be sealed for goodness. Amen.\r\n');
