How do you handle admin features with templates?

Every admin page must be protected from non-logged in users:

	Add protection to each specific api call.
		or
	Add admin specific checks to template controller
		->	call admin if not logged in, include login template,
			else include the appropriate template.
			
		->	if logged in, but not admin, redirect to 
			
		cons: this adds inappropriate functionality to the template controller
		
	Create an admin template / controller and give it one api call to protect the admin site.
