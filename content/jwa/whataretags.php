		<h1>What are Tags?</h1>
	<p>Tagging is a freeform way to categorize items, which is being used on a growing number of websites. A tag can refer to a general category or description, such as "Biloxi" or "synagogue", or to a concept, like "hope" or "community," or it can be more personal, "Sanford Cohen". An item can be tagged with as many, or as few tags as seems useful to you. A tag on this site can contain more than one word. Multiple tags are separated by commas.</p>

<p>You can see what tags other people are using, and what items they are categorizing, by exploring our "tag cloud" graphic, or by looking at the tags listed as part of each item's description. Clicking on separate tag links will show you other items that share a given tag.</p>

<p>You can add, delete, or edit the tags that you have assigned (but not anyone else's tags) whenever you are logged in to this website. If you feel that someone else's tag is inappropriate, you may <a href="<?php echo $_link->to('contact'); ?>" onclick="return targetopener(this)" rev="contact">contact us (returns you to the main window)</a>.</p>
