			<h3><a id="personally" class="namedanchor">I wasn&#8217;t personally affected by Hurricane Katrina. Should I still contribute my story, image or other file?</a></h3>
			<p>Yes! We want to hear from you. In addition to the stories of those who were directly impacted by Hurricane Katrina, we are interested in hearing about the experiences of members of regional Jewish communities who helped settle and care for evacuees, and individuals and organizations across the country who participated in relief efforts.</p>
			<p>We are also interested in your memories of the community before Hurricane Katrina struck, as well as your thoughts and hopes for the future. </p>

			<h3><a id="multiple-stories" class="namedanchor">I would like to contribute multiple stories, images or other files to <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite>. Do I have to upload them one by one?</a></h3>
			<p>If you are only submitting a few items, we ask that you upload them one by one through our online interface Just click on &#8220;Add Your Voice&#8221; to access the contribution form. You will only be asked to complete the background questions one time.

			<h3><a id="tagging" class="namedanchor">What is a tag? How do I use them?</a></h3>
			<p>Tagging is a freeform way to categorize objects that helps people search across online collections more efficiently. A tag can refer to a general category or description (such as &#8220;Biloxi&#8221; or &#8220;synagogue&#8221;), or to a concept (like &#8220;hope&#8221; or &#8220;evacuation&#8221;), or it can be more personal (such as &#8220;Sanford Cohen&#8221;). </p>
			<p>You can tag the objects you submit to <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> with as many, or as few, tags as seem useful to you. A tag on this site can contain more than one word (for example, &#8220;Beth Israel Congregation&#8221; or &#8220;Lakeview District&#8221;). Multiple tags are separated by commas. You can facilitate the process of finding objects contributed by other members of your community or family by assigning common tags, such as &#8220;Touro Synagogue&#8221; or &#8220;Wise Family.&#8221; </p>
			<p>You can see what tags other people are using by exploring our &#8220;tag cloud&#8221; graphic, or by looking at the tags listed as part of each object&#8217;s description. When you click on a tag in the &#8220;tag cloud,&#8221; you will be taken to a page from which you can browse all objects that share that tag. You can also put tags in the search box and use them as part of your search.</p>
			<p>You can add, delete, or edit the tags that you have assigned to any object you have contributed whenever you are logged in to this website. You may also add tags to another person&#8217;s contributions (although you can&#8217;t delete or edit tags others have contributed). If you feel that someone else&#8217;s tag is inappropriate or inaccurate, you may contact us.</p>

			<h3><a id="womenandmen" class="namedanchor">I thought <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> only collects women&#8217;s stories. Is that true for this collection?</a></h3>

			<h3><a  class="namedanchor" id="authenticity">How do I know that the contents of <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> are authentic and factually accurate?</a></h3>
			<p>Most people who make the effort to submit an object to <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> share the goal of its organizers&mdash;that is, to create a reliable and permanent record about the Jewish communities of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and of the Jewish community&#8217;s experiences of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath&mdash;and therefore most contributions are authentic.</p>
			<p>That said, <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> cannot vouch for the factual accuracy of any individual contribution. We do know, however, that every submission to <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> Ð even those that prove to be erroneous, misleading, or dubious Ð can contribute in some way to the historical record. A misleading individual account, for example, could reveal certain personal and emotional aspects of the event that would otherwise be lost in a strict authentication and appraisal process.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, as with any historical sources (including, for example, newspaper accounts), there are always questions about reliability, and all researchers need to evaluate their sources critically. It is for this reason that <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> requests information from every contributor&mdash;including name, email address, location, zip code, gender, age, occupation, and date received. As part of its evaluation process for each submission, <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> verifies that the contributor exists at the email s/he lists. We also urge researchers to examine the metadata in relation to one another, in relation to the content of the submission, and in relation to other authenticated records. Sound research technique is the basis of sound scholarship. Researchers with particular concerns should <a href="<?php echo $_link->to('contact'); ?>">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
