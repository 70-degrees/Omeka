			<h3><a id="overview" class="namedanchor">Overview</a></h3>
			<p><cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> is an online history project to collect, preserve, and present the American Jewish community&#8217;s experiences of Hurricane Katrina and their recollections of the Jewish communities of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The <a href="http://www.jwa.org">Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive</a> organized the project, in collaboration with the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu">Center for History and New Media</a>, with generous funding from foundations and individual donors.</p>

			<p><cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> welcomes members of the Jewish communities of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, as well as Jews across the country, to tell their own stories of how the storm affected them. The project is collecting digital artifacts in a variety of forms, including photos, blog postings, podcasts, emails, essays and other first-hand accounts, from American Jews nationwide.</p>

			<p>These collections will serve as a vital resource for future historians of the American Jewish experience, as well as for those interested in exploring how individuals and different faith communities responded to this vast humanitarian crisis.</p>

			<p>Sharing our stories is also a way to create powerful connections in the present. We hope that those who contribute to this virtual archive and those who immerse themselves in the stories and images they find here come away moved and inspired by these varied Jewish voices of Katrina.</p>

			<h3><a id="about-oral-history" class="namedanchor">About the <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> Oral History Project</a></h3>

			<p>In a complementary part of the <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> project, <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> is partnering with the Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life (<abbr title="Institute of Southern Jewish Life">ISJL</abbr>) to conduct 75&#8211;100 in-depth oral histories with members of the Jewish communities of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. This will enable a wide cross-section of these historic Jewish communities to serve as &#8220;historic witnesses&#8221; to a watershed event in its (and our) communal history. These interviews will be permanently housed at ISJL and made available on the <abbr title="Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive">JWA</abbr> website. For more information about the <cite>Katrina&#8217;s Jewish Voices</cite> oral history project, please visit the <a href="http://www.jwa.org/press/#katrina">Jewish Women&#8217;s Archive Pressroom</a>.</p>
